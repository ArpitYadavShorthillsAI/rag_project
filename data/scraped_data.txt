[ 16 ] [ 17 ] [ 18 ] The attacks, which drew widespread global condemnation, began on Wednesday, 26 November, and lasted until Saturday, 29 November 2008. A total of 175 people died, including nine of the attackers, with more than 300 injured. [ 4 ] [ 5 ] [ 19 ] Eight of the attacks occurred in South Mumbai at Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus , the Oberoi Trident , the Taj Mahal Palace and Tower hotel , [ 2 ] the Leopold Cafe , the Cama Hospital , [ 2 ] the Nariman House , [ 20 ] [ 21 ] the Metro Cinema , [ 1 ] and in a lane behind the Times of India building and St. Xavier's College . [ 2 ] Also, an explosion occurred at Mazagaon , in Mumbai's port area, and in a taxi at Vile Parle . [ 22 ] By the early morning of 28 November, all sites except for the Taj Hotel had been secured by the Mumbai Police and security forces. On 29 November, India's National Security Guards conducted Operation Black Tornado to flush out the remaining attackers; it culminated in the death of the last remaining attackers at the Taj Hotel and ended the attacks. [ 23 ] Before his execution in 2012, Ajmal Kasab , [ 24 ] the sole surviving attacker, claimed that the attackers were members of the terrorist group Lashkar-e-Taiba , [ 25 ] and were controlled from Pakistan, corroborating initial claims from the Indian Government. [ 26 ] Pakistan later confirmed that the sole surviving perpetrator of the attacks was a Pakistani citizen. [ 27 ] [ 28 ] On 9 April 2015, the foremost ringleader of the attacks, Zakiur Rehman Lakhvi , was released on bail and disappeared; [ 29 ] he was arrested again in Lahore on 2 January 2021. [ 30 ] [ 31 ] In 2018, former Pakistani prime minister Nawaz Sharif questioned the Pakistani government's allowance of those who committed the attacks to cross into India. [ 32 ] In 2022, one of the masterminds of the attack, Sajid Majeed Mir —who had earlier been claimed to be dead by the Pakistan Government— was convicted for funding terrorist activities by an anti-terrorism court in Pakistan.

[ 36 ] The 1993 attacks were carried out in the name of revenge for the earlier Bombay riots , in which many Muslims were killed. [ 37 ] On 6 December 2002, a blast in a BEST bus near Ghatkopar station killed two people and injured 28. [ 38 ] The bombing occurred on the 10th anniversary of the demolition of the Babri Mosque in Ayodhya . [ 39 ] A bicycle bomb exploded near the Vile Parle station in Mumbai, killing one person and injuring 25 on 27 January 2003, a day before the visit of the Prime Minister of India Atal Bihari Vajpayee to the city. [ 40 ] On 13 March 2003, a day after the 10th anniversary of the 1993 Bombay bombings, a bomb exploded in a train compartment near the Mulund station, killing 10 people and injuring 70. [ 41 ] On 28 July 2003, a blast in a BEST bus in Ghatkopar killed 4 people and injured 32. [ 42 ] On 25 August 2003, two bombs exploded in South Mumbai, one near the Gateway of India and the other at Zaveri Bazaar in Kalbadevi . At least 44 people were killed and 150 injured. [ 43 ] On 11 July 2006, seven bombs exploded within 11 minutes on the Suburban Railway in Mumbai, [ 44 ] killing 209 people, including 22 foreigners [ 45 ] [ 46 ] [ 47 ] and more than 700 injured. [ 48 ] [ 49 ] According to the Mumbai Police , the bombings were carried out by Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) and Students Islamic Movement of India (SIMI). [ 50 ] [ 51 ] Training [ edit ] A group of men said to number between 24 and 26 [ 52 ] received training in marine warfare at a remote camp in mountainous Muzaffarabad in Pakistan. [ why? ] Part of the training was said to have taken place on the Mangla Dam reservoir in Pakistan. [ 53 ] The recruits went through extensive training: Psychological: Indoctrination to Islamist jihadi ideas, including imagery of atrocities suffered by Muslims in India [ 54 ] and globally. Basic combat: Lashkar's basic combat training and methodology course, the Daura Aam Advanced training: Selected to undergo advanced combat training at a camp near Mansehra , a course the organisation calls the Daura Khaas . [ 54 ] According to an unnamed source at the U.S. Defense Department , this includes advanced weapons and explosives training supervised by former members of the Pakistan Army , [ 26 ] along with survival training and further indoctrination . Commando training: Finally, an even smaller group was selected for specialized commando tactics training, and marine navigation training was given to the Fedayeen unit that was selected, to target Mumbai. [ 55 ] From the recruits, 10 were handpicked for the Mumbai mission. [ 56 ] They also received training in swimming and sailing, besides the use of high-end weapons and explosives under the supervision of LeT commanders. According to a media report citing an unnamed former Department of Defense official of the US, the intelligence agencies of the US had determined [ when? ] that former officers from Pakistan's Army and Inter-Services Intelligence agency assisted actively and continuously in training. [ 26 ] They were given blueprints of all the four targets – The Taj Mahal Palace Hotel , Oberoi Trident , Nariman House , and Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus . Attacks [ edit ] For a chronological guide, see Timeline of the 2008 Mumbai attacks . The terrorists first hijacked an Indian fishing boat and killed five people on board. [ 57 ] The first events were detailed around 20:00 Indian Standard Time (IST) on 26 November, when 10 men in inflatable speedboats came ashore at two locations in Colaba . [ 58 ] They reportedly told local Marathi -speaking fishermen who asked them who they were to ""mind their own business"" before they split up and went in two different ways. The fishermen's' subsequent report to the police department received little response and local police failed to act. [ 59 ] Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus [ edit ] Bullet holes on the wall at the CSMT The Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus (CSMT) was attacked by two gunmen, Ismail Khan and Ajmal Kasab . [ 60 ] Kasab was later caught alive by the police and identified by eyewitnesses. The attacks began around 21:30, when the two men entered the passenger hall and opened fire [ 61 ] with AK-47 assault rifles . [ 62 ] The attackers killed 58 people and injured 104 others, [ 62 ] their assault ending at about 22:45. [ 61 ] Security forces and emergency services arrived shortly afterwards. Announcements by a railway announcer, Vishnu Dattaram Zende, alerted passengers to leave the station, which saved many lives. [ 63 ] [ 64 ] The two gunmen fled the scene and fired at pedestrians and police officers in the streets, killing eight police officers. The attackers passed a police station. Knowing that they were outgunned against the heavily armed terrorists, the police officers at the station, instead of confronting the terrorists, decided to switch off the lights and secure the gates. [ citation needed ] The attackers then headed towards Cama Hospital with intent to kill patients, [ 65 ] but the hospital staff locked all of the patient wards. A team of the Mumbai Anti-Terrorist Squad , led by Police Chief Hemant Karkare , searched the Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus and then left in pursuit of Kasab and Khan. Kasab and Khan opened fire on the vehicle in a lane next to the hospital and received return fire in response. Karkare, Vijay Salaskar , Ashok Kamte , and three of their officers were killed. The only survivor, Constable Arun Jadhav, was severely wounded. [ 66 ] Kasab and Khan seized the police vehicle but later abandoned it and seized a passenger car instead. They then ran into a police roadblock, which had been set up after Jadhav radioed for help. [ 67 ] A gun battle then ensued in which Khan was killed and Kasab was wounded. After a physical struggle, Kasab was arrested. [ 68 ] A police officer, Tukaram Omble , was also killed when he tried to disarm Kasab by wrestling his weapon away from him. [ citation needed ] Leopold Cafe [ edit ] Bullet marks left at Leopold Cafe The Leopold Cafe, a popular restaurant and bar on Colaba Causeway in South Mumbai, was one of the first sites to be attacked. [ 69 ] Two attackers, Shoaib alias Soheb and Nazir alias Abu Umer, [ 60 ] opened fire on the cafe on the evening of 26 November between 21:30 and 21:48, killing 10 people (including some international visitors) and injuring many more. [ 70 ] Bomb blasts in taxis [ edit ] Two explosions happened in taxis caused by time bombs . The first one occurred at 22:40 at Vile Parle, killing the driver and a passenger. The second explosion took place at Wadi Bunder between 22:20 and 22:25. Three people, including the driver of the taxi, were killed, and about 15 others were injured. [ 22 ] [ 71 ] Taj Mahal Palace Hotel and Oberoi Trident [ edit ] The damaged Oberoi Trident hotel Two hotels, the Taj Mahal Palace Hotel and the Oberoi Trident, were among the four locations targeted. Six explosions were reported at the Taj Hotel – one in the lobby, two in the elevators, and three in the restaurant – and one at the Oberoi Trident. [ 72 ] [ 73 ] At the Taj, firefighters rescued 200 hostages from windows using ladders during the first night. [ 74 ] CNN initially reported on the morning of 27 November 2008 that the hostage situation at the Taj Hotel had been resolved and quoted the police chief of Maharashtra , stating that all hostages were freed; [ 46 ] later that day, though, two attackers were found to be still holding hostages, including foreigners, in the Taj Hotel. [ 75 ] The first floor of the Taj Hotel was completely gutted. A number of European Parliament Committee on International Trade delegates were staying in the Taj Hotel when it was attacked, [ 76 ] but none of them were injured. [ 77 ] British Conservative Member of the European Parliament (MEP) Sajjad Karim (who was in the lobby when attackers initially opened fire there) and German Social Democrat MEP Erika Mann were hiding in different parts of the building. [ 76 ] Also reported present was Spanish MEP Ignasi Guardans , who was barricaded in a hotel room. [ 78 ] [ 79 ] Another British Conservative MEP, Syed Kamall , reported that he along with several other MEPs left the hotel and went to a nearby restaurant shortly before the attack. [ 76 ] Kamall also reported that Polish MEP Jan Masiel was thought to have been sleeping in his hotel room when the attacks started, but eventually left the hotel safely. [ 80 ] Kamall and Guardans reported that a Hungarian MEP's assistant was shot. [ 76 ] [ 81 ] Also caught up in the shooting were the President of Madrid , Esperanza Aguirre , while checking in at the Oberoi Trident, [ 81 ] and Indian MP N. N. Krishnadas of Kerala and Gulam Noon while having dinner at a restaurant in the Taj Hotel. [ 82 ] [ 83 ] Gautam Adani , a billionaire business tycoon of India, was having dinner in the Taj on November 26; he hid in the hotel kitchen and later in the toilet, and came out safely the next morning. [ 84 ] [ 85 ] [ 86 ] Nariman House [ edit ] Front view of the Nariman House a week after the attacks Nariman House, a Chabad Lubavitch Jewish centre in Colaba known as the Mumbai Chabad House , was taken over by two attackers, and several residents were held hostage. [ 87 ] Police evacuated adjacent buildings and exchanged fire with the attackers, wounding one. Local residents were told to stay inside. The attackers threw a grenade into a nearby lane, causing no casualties. NSG commandos arrived from Delhi , and a naval helicopter took an aerial survey. During the first day, 9 hostages were rescued from the first floor. The following day, the house was stormed by NSG commandos fast-roping from helicopters onto the roof, covered by snipers positioned in nearby buildings. After a long battle, [ clarification needed ] one NSG commando, Sergeant Gajender Singh Bisht was killed, as were both perpetrators. [ 88 ] [ 89 ] Rabbi Gavriel Holtzberg and his wife Rivka Holtzberg , who was six months pregnant, were murdered [ how? ] with four other hostages inside the house by the attackers. [ 90 ] According to radio transmissions picked up by Indian intelligence, the attackers ""would be told by their handlers in Pakistan that the lives of Jews were worth 50 times those of non-Jews"". [ attribution needed ] Injuries on some of the bodies indicated that they may have been tortured. [ 91 ] [ 92 ] NSG Commandos beginning the assault on Nariman House by fast-roping onto the terrace. NSG raid [ edit ] During the attacks, both hotels were surrounded by Rapid Action Force personnel, Marine Commandos (MARCOS), and National Security Guards (NSG) commandos. [ 93 ] [ 94 ] When reports emerged that attackers were receiving television broadcasts, feeds to the hotels were blocked. [ 95 ] Security forces stormed both hotels, and all nine attackers were killed by the morning of 29 November. [ 96 ] [ 97 ] Major Sandeep Unnikrishnan of the NSG was fatally shot during the rescue of Commando Sunil Yadav, who was hit in the leg by a bullet during the rescue operations at Taj. [ 98 ] [ 99 ] 32 hostages were killed at the Oberoi Trident. [ 100 ] NSG commandos then took on the Nariman House, and a naval helicopter took an aerial survey. During the first day, nine hostages were rescued from the first floor. The following day, the house was stormed by NSG commandos fast-roping from helicopters onto the roof, covered by snipers positioned in nearby buildings. NSG Commando Sergeant Gajender Singh Bisht , who was part of the team that fast-roped onto Nariman House, died from injuries sustained by a grenade [ 101 ] after a long battle in which both perpetrators were also killed. [ 88 ] [ 89 ] By the morning of 28 November, the NSG had secured the Jewish outreach centre at Nariman House, as well as the Oberoi Trident hotel. They also incorrectly believed that the Taj Palace and Towers had been cleared of attackers, and soldiers were leading hostages and holed-up guests to safety, and removing bodies of those killed in the attacks. [ 102 ] [ 103 ] [ 104 ] However, later news reports indicated that two or three attackers were still in the Taj, with explosions heard and gunfire exchanged. [ 104 ] Fires were also reported at the ground floor of the Taj, with plumes of smoke arising from the first floor. [ 104 ] The final operation at the Taj Palace hotel was completed by the NSG commandos at 08:00 on 29 November, killing three attackers and resulting in the conclusion of the attacks. [ 105 ] The NSG rescued 250 people from the Oberoi, 300 from the Taj, and 60 (members of 12 different families) from Nariman House. [ 106 ] In addition, police seized a boat filled with arms and explosives anchored at Mazgaon dock off Mumbai Harbour. [ 107 ] Attribution [ edit ] Ajmal Kasab at Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus with an AK-47 in his hand Main articles: Attribution of the 2008 Mumbai attacks and Erroneous reporting on the 2008 Mumbai attacks The search regarding the identity of the terrorists started during the first attacks. During the searches, an unknown group calling itself the Mujahideen Hyderabad Deccan claimed responsibility for attacks in an email, which was later traced to Pakistan and was regarded as hoax . [ 108 ] The Mumbai attacks were planned and directed by Lashkar-e-Taiba militants inside Pakistan and carried out by 10 young armed men trained and sent to Mumbai and directed from inside Pakistan by mobile phones and VoIP. [ 109 ] [ 26 ] [ 110 ] In July 2009, Pakistani authorities confirmed that LeT plotted and financed the attacks from LeT camps in Karachi and Thatta . [ 111 ] In November 2009, Pakistani authorities charged seven men they had arrested earlier, of planning and executing the assault. [ 18 ] Mumbai police department originally identified 37 suspects—including two Pakistani army officers—for their alleged involvement in the plot. All but two of the suspects, many of whom are identified only through aliases, are Pakistani. [ 112 ] David Coleman Headley and Tahawwur Hussain Rana , arrested in the United States in October 2009 for other attacks, were also found to have been involved in planning the Mumbai attacks. [ 113 ] [ 114 ] One of these men, Pakistani American David Headley (born Daood Sayed Gilani), was found to have made several trips to India before the attacks, and gathered video and GPS information on behalf of the plotters. In April 2011, the United States issued arrest warrants for four Pakistani men as suspects in the attack. Three men, Sajid Mir , Abu Qahafa, and Mazhar Iqbal, alias "" Major Iqbal "", were believed to be members of Lashkar-e-Taiba, and helped plan and train the attackers. [ 115 ] Negotiations with Pakistan [ edit ] Pakistani Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gillani and President Asif Ali Zardari condemned the attacks. [ 116 ] [ 117 ] Pakistan promised to assist in the investigation, and President Zardari vowed ""strong action against any Pakistani elements found involved in the attack"". [ 118 ] Pakistan initially denied that Pakistanis were responsible for the attacks, blaming plotters in Bangladesh and Indian criminals, [ 119 ] a claim refuted by India, [ 120 ] and saying they needed information from India on other bombings first. [ 121 ] Pakistani authorities finally agreed that Ajmal Kasab was a Pakistani on 7 January 2009, [ 28 ] [ 122 ] [ 123 ] and registered a case against three other Pakistani nationals. [ 124 ] The Indian government supplied evidence to Pakistan and other governments, in the form of interrogations, weapons, and call records of conversations during the attacks. [ 125 ] [ 126 ] In addition, Indian government officials said that the attacks were so sophisticated that they must have had official backing from Pakistani ""agencies"", an accusation denied by Pakistan. [ 26 ] [ 122 ] Pakistan arrested a few members of Jamaat ud-Dawa and briefly put its founder under house arrest, but he was found to be free a few days later. [ 127 ] A year after the attacks, Mumbai police continued to complain that Pakistani authorities were not co-operating by providing information for their investigation. [ 128 ] Meanwhile, journalists in Pakistan said security agencies were preventing them from interviewing people from Kasab's village. [ 129 ] [ 130 ] The then Home Minister P. Chidambaram said the Pakistani authorities had not shared any information about American suspects David Headley and Tahawwur Hussain Rana , but that the FBI had been more forthcoming. [ 131 ] An Indian report, summarising intelligence gained from India's interrogation of David Headley, [ 132 ] was released in October 2010. It alleged that Pakistan's intelligence agency (ISI) had provided support for the attacks by providing funding for reconnaissance missions in Mumbai. [ 133 ] The report included Headley's claim that Lashkar-e-Taiba's chief military commander, Zaki-ur-Rahman Lakhvi, had close ties to the ISI. [ 132 ] He alleged that ""every big action of LeT is done in close coordination with [the] ISI."" [ 133 ] In 2018, during an interview with newspaper Dawn , [ 32 ] Pakistan's former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif questioned Pakistan's inaction in preventing the Mumbai attacks. [ 134 ] [ 135 ] [ 136 ] Police are looking for attackers outside Colaba. Investigation [ edit ] According to investigations, the attackers travelled by sea from Karachi , Pakistan, across the Arabian Sea , hijacked the Indian fishing trawler Kuber , killed the crew of four, then forced the captain to sail to Mumbai. After murdering the captain, the attackers entered Mumbai on a rubber dinghy . The captain of Kuber , Amar Singh Solanki, had earlier been imprisoned for six months in a Pakistani jail for illegally fishing in Pakistani waters. [ 137 ] The attackers stayed and were trained by the Lashkar-e-Taiba in a safehouse at Azizabad in Karachi before boarding a small boat for Mumbai. [ 138 ] David Headley was a member of Lashkar-e-Taiba, and between 2002 and 2009, Headley travelled extensively as part of his work for LeT. Headley received training in small arms and countersurveillance from LeT, built a network of connections for the group, and lead in scoping out targets for Mumbai attack [ 139 ] [ 140 ] having allegedly been given $25,000 in cash in 2006 by an ISI officer known as Major Iqbal . The officer also helped him arrange a communications system for the attack and oversaw a model of the Taj Hotel, so that gunmen could know their way inside the target, according to Headley's testimony to Indian authorities. Headley also helped ISI recruit Indian agents to monitor Indian troop levels and movements, according to a US official. At the same time, Headley was also an informant for the US Drug Enforcement Administration , and Headley's wives warned American officials of Headley's involvement with LeT and his plotting attacks, warning specifically that the Taj Hotel may be their target. [ 139 ] US officials believed that the ISI officers provided support to LeT militants who carried out the attacks. [ 141 ] Disclosures made by former American intelligence contractor Edward Snowden in 2013 revealed that the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) had intercepted communications between the Lashkar boat and the LeT headquarters in Pakistan-administered Kashmir and passed the alert on to RAW on 18 November, eight days before the terrorists actually struck Mumbai. [ 142 ] In the hours after the attack, the New York City Police Department sent Brandon del Pozo , an official from their intelligence division, to investigate the incident to understand what vulnerabilities its methods posed for New York City. [ 143 ] The arrest of Zabiuddin Ansari , alias Abu Hamza, in June 2012 provided further clarity on how the plot was hatched. According to Abu Hamza, the attacks were previously scheduled for 2006, using Indian youth for the job. However, a huge cache of AK-47s and RDX , which were to be used for the attacks, was recovered from Aurangabad in 2006, thus leading to the dismantling of the original plot. Subsequently, Abu Hamza fled to Pakistan and along with Lashkar commanders, scouted for Pakistani youth to be used for the attacks. In September 2007, 10 people were selected for the mission. In September 2008, these people tried sailing to Mumbai from Karachi, but could not complete their mission due to choppy waters. These men made a second attempt in November 2008, and successfully managed to execute the final attacks. David Headley's disclosures that three Pakistani army officers were associated with the planning and execution of the attack were substantiated by Ansari's revelations during his interrogation. [ 144 ] [ 145 ] After Ansari's arrest, Pakistan's Foreign Office claimed they had received information that up to 40 Indian nationals were involved in the attacks. [ 146 ] Method [ edit ] The attackers had planned the attack several months ahead of time, and knew some areas well enough to vanish and reappear after security forces had left. Several sources have quoted Kasab telling the police that the group received help from Mumbai residents. [ 147 ] [ 148 ] The attackers used at least three SIM cards purchased on the Indian side of the border with Bangladesh . [ 149 ] There were also reports of a SIM card purchased in the US state of New Jersey . [ 150 ] Police had also mentioned that Faheem Ansari , an Indian Lashkar operative who had been arrested in February 2008, had scouted the Mumbai targets for the November attacks. [ 151 ] Later, the police arrested two Indian suspects, Mikhtar Ahmad, who is from Srinagar in Kashmir, and Tausif Rehman, a resident of Kolkata. They supplied the SIM cards, one in Calcutta, and the other in New Delhi. [ 152 ] The attackers used a satellite phone and cell phones to talk to each other, as well as their handlers who were based in Pakistan. In transcripts intercepted by Indian authorities between the attackers and their handlers, the handlers provided the attackers with encouragement, tactical advice, and information gained from media coverage. The attackers used both personal cell phones and those obtained from their victims to communicate with each other and the news media. Although the attackers were encouraged to murder hostages, the attackers were in communication with the news media via cell phones to make demands in return for the release of hostages. This was believed to be done to further confuse Indian authorities that they were dealing with primarily a hostage situation. [ 153 ] Type 86 grenades made by China's state-owned Norinco were used in the attacks. [ 154 ] Also, indications arose that the attackers had been taking cocaine. [ 155 ] The gunman who survived said that the attackers had used Google Earth to familiarise themselves with the locations of buildings used in the attacks. [ 156 ] Of the 10 gunmen, nine were subsequently shot dead and one was captured by security forces. [ 157 ] [ 158 ] Witnesses reported that they seemed to be in their early 20s, wore black T-shirts and jeans, and smiled and looked happy as they shot their victims. [ 159 ] Initially, some of the attackers reported to be British citizens, [ 160 ] [ 161 ] but the Indian government later stated that there was no evidence to confirm this. [ 162 ] Similarly, early reports of 12 gunmen [ 163 ] were also later shown to be incorrect. [ 125 ] On 9 December, the 10 attackers were identified by Mumbai police, along with their home towns in Pakistan: Ajmal Amir Kasab from Faridkot , Abu Ismail Dera Ismail Khan from Dera Ismail Khan , Hafiz Arshad and Babr Imran from Multan , Javed from Okara , Shoaib from Sialkot , Nazir Ahmed and Nasir from Faisalabad , Abdul Rahman from Arifwalla , and Fahadullah from Dipalpur Taluka . Dera Ismail Khan is in the North-West Frontier Province ; the rest of the towns are in Pakistani Punjab . [ 164 ] On 6 April 2010, the Home Minister of Maharashtra , informed the assembly that the bodies of the nine killed Pakistani gunmen from the 2008 attack on Mumbai were buried in a secret location in January 2010. The bodies had been in the mortuary of a Mumbai hospital after Muslim clerics in the city refused to let them be buried on their grounds. [ 165 ] Attackers [ edit ] Only one of the attackers, Ajmal Kasab, survived the attack. He was hanged in Yerwada Central Jail in 2012. [ 166 ] Arrests [ edit ] Main articles: Ajmal Kasab and Zabiuddin Ansari Ajmal Kasab was the only attacker arrested by police. At first, he deposed to police inspector Ramesh Mahale that he had come to India ""to see Amitabh Bachchan 's bungalow"", and that he was apprehended by the Mumbai Police outside the bungalow. [ 54 ] [ 167 ] Much of the information about the attackers' preparation, travel, and movements comes from his subsequent confessions to the Mumbai police. [ 168 ] On 12 February 2009, Pakistani Interior Minister Rehman Malik said that Pakistani national Javed Iqbal, who acquired VoIP phones in Spain for the Mumbai attackers, and Hamad Ameen Sadiq, who had facilitated money transfer for the attack, had been arrested. [ 124 ] Two other men known as Khan and Riaz, but whose full names were not given, were also arrested. [ 7 ] Two Pakistanis were arrested in Brescia , Italy (east of Milan ), on 21 November 2009, after being accused of providing logistical support to the attacks and transferring more than US$200 to Internet accounts using a false ID. [ 169 ] [ 170 ] They had Red Corner Notices issued against them by Interpol for their suspected involvement and it was issued after the last year's strikes. [ 171 ] In October 2009, two Chicago men were arrested and charged by the FBI for involvement in ""terrorism"" abroad, David Coleman Headley and Tahawwur Hussain Rana. Headley, a Pakistani American, was charged in November 2009 with scouting locations for the 2008 Mumbai attacks. [ 172 ] [ 173 ] Headley is reported to have posed as an American Jew and is believed to have links with militant Islamist groups based in Bangladesh. [ 174 ] On 18 March 2010, Headley pleaded guilty to a dozen charges against him thereby avoiding going to trial. In December 2009, the FBI charged Abdur Rehman Hashim Syed , a retired major in the Pakistani Army , for planning the attacks in association with Headley. [ 175 ] On 15 January 2010, in a successful snatch operation, R&AW agents nabbed Sheikh Abdul Khwaja, one of the handlers of the 26/11 attacks, chief of HuJI India operations and a most wanted suspect in India, from Colombo , Sri Lanka, and brought him over to Hyderabad, India , for formal arrest. [ 176 ] On 25 June 2012, the Delhi Police Department arrested Zabiuddin Ansari, alias Abu Hamza, one of the key suspects in the attack at the Indira Gandhi International Airport in New Delhi. His arrest was touted as the most significant development in the case since Kasab's arrest. [ 177 ] Security agencies had been chasing him for three years in Delhi. Ansari is a LeT ultra and the Hindi tutor of the 10 attackers who were responsible for the Mumbai attacks in 2008. [ 178 ] [ 179 ] He was apprehended, after he was arrested and deported to India by Saudi Intelligence officials as per official request by Indian authorities. [ 180 ] After Ansari's arrest, investigations revealed that in 2009 he allegedly stayed for a day in a room in Old Legislators's Hostel, belonging to Fauzia Khan, a former MLA and minister in Maharashtra Government. The minister, however, denied having any links with him. Home Minister P. Chidambaram asserted that Ansari was provided a safe place in Pakistan and was present in the control room, which could not have been established without active State support. Ansari's interrogation further revealed that Sajid Mir and a Pakistani Army major visited India under fake names as cricket spectators to survey targets in Delhi and Mumbai for about a fortnight. [ 181 ] [ 182 ] [ 183 ] Sajid Mir , a Pakistani citizen and key operative of the militant Islamic extremist group LeT, [ 184 ] [ 185 ] is seen as one of the main organizers of the 2008 attacks. [ 186 ] [ 187 ] He has been called the ""mastermind"" [ 188 ] and ""project manager"". [ 185 ] Mir is on the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation 's Most Wanted list and the United States Department of State offers in its Rewards for Justice Program , [ 189 ] a reward of up to $5 million for information leading to the arrest and conviction of Mir. [ 190 ] [ 191 ] Mir has carried out terrorism operations in different parts of the world, including France. [ 186 ] Jason M. Blazakis, professor of practice at Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey , stated in 2018 in The Hill : ""A lethal, miasmic mix of bureaucratic inertia, diplomatic dysfunction and misperception has contributed to the fact that LeT members Sajid Mir , Mazhar Iqbal, Abu Qahafa (his nom de guerre), and their ISI handler, Major Iqbal (no relation to Mazhar), roam free.""

Among the dead were 29 foreign nationals. [ 4 ] [ 5 ] [ 46 ] [ 216 ] [ 217 ] [ 218 ] One attacker was captured. [ 219 ] The bodies of many of the dead hostages showed signs of torture or disfigurement. [ 220 ] A number of those killed were notable figures in business, media, and security services. [ 221 ] [ 222 ] [ 223 ] The chief minister of Maharashtra , Vilasrao Deshmukh , said that 15 policemen and two NSG commandos were killed, including the following officers: [ 216 ] [ 223 ] Assistant Police Sub-Inspector Tukaram Omble , [ 224 ] who succeeded in capturing a terrorist alive, with his bare hands. Joint Commissioner of Police Hemant Karkare , the Chief of the Mumbai Anti-Terrorism Squad [ 222 ] Additional Commissioner of Police: Ashok Kamte [ 222 ] Encounter specialist Senior Inspector Vijay Salaskar [ 222 ] Senior Inspector Shashank Shinde [ 222 ] NSG Commando, Major Sandeep Unnikrishnan NSG Commando, Hawaldar Gajender Singh Bisht Three railway officials of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus were also killed.

[ 236 ] In August 2009, the Indian Hotels Company and the Oberoi Group received about US$28 million as part-payment of the insurance claims, on account of the attacks on Taj and Trident, from General Insurance Corporation of India. [ 237 ] Aftermath [ edit ] Main article: Aftermath of the 2008 Mumbai attacks The attacks are sometimes referred to in India as ""26/11"", after the date in 2008 that the attacks began. The Pradhan Inquiry Commission , appointed by the Maharashtra government, produced a report that was tabled before the legislative assembly more than a year after the events. The report said the ""war-like"" attack was beyond the capacity to respond of any police force, but also found fault with the Mumbai Police Commissioner Hasan Gafoor 's lack of leadership during the crisis. [ 238 ] The Maharashtra government planned to buy 36 speed boats to patrol the coastal areas and several helicopters for the same purpose. It also planned to create an anti-terror force called "" Force One "" and upgrade all the weapons that Mumbai police currently have. [ 239 ] Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on an all-party conference declared that legal framework would be strengthened in the battle against terrorism and a federal anti-terrorist intelligence and investigation agency, like the FBI , will be set up soon to co-ordinate action against terrorism. [ 240 ] The government strengthened anti-terror laws with UAPA 2008, and the federal National Investigation Agency was formed. A Public Interest Litigation has been filed by social activist Ketan Tirodkar to demand equal justice for all the police who were killed in the terror attack; especially for the members of the Bomb Disposal Squad of Mumbai Police. During the hearing of the petition, the Government informed the High Court that the Federal Government of India has rejected the proposal to award the Bomb Disposal Squad of the city police for their contribution in defusing grenades in the terror attack. [ 241 ] [ 242 ] [ 243 ] The attacks further strained India's slowly recovering relationship with Pakistan. India's then External Affairs Minister Pranab Mukherjee declared that India may indulge in military strikes against terror camps in Pakistan to protect its territorial integrity. There were also after-effects on the United States's relationships with both countries, [ 244 ] the US-led NATO war in Afghanistan , [ 245 ] and on the Global War on Terror . [ 246 ] FBI chief Robert Mueller praised the ""unprecedented cooperation"" between American and Indian intelligence agencies over the Mumbai terror attack probe. [ 247 ] However, Interpol secretary general Ronald Noble said that Indian intelligence agencies did not share any information with Interpol. [ 248 ] A new National Counter Terrorism Centre (NCTC) was proposed to be set up by the then-Home Minister P. Chidambaram as an office to collect, collate, summarise, integrate, analyse, co-ordinate and report all information and inputs received from various intelligence agencies, state police departments, and other ministries and their departments. The Mumbai attack, along with 2016 Uri attack and the 2019 Pulwama attack , led to an increase in anti-Pakistan sentiments across India. [ 249 ] Similar sentiments were echoed elsewhere, most notably in the United States of America, as 6 American citizens were killed in the attack. [ 194 ] Following the attack, as well as raid in Abbottabad , anti-Pakistan views and hate crimes against Pakistani origin people surged in the United States. [ 250 ] [ 251 ] Due to such hate crimes and views, many Pakistanis and Pakistani-Americans have identified themselves as Indians to avoid discrimination and obtain jobs. [ 252 ] Movement of troops [ edit ] Pakistan moved troops towards the border with India voicing concerns about the Indian government's possible plans to launch attacks on Pakistani soil if it did not co-operate. After days of talks, the Pakistan government, however, decided to start moving troops away from the border. [ 253 ] Reactions [ edit ] Main article: Reactions to the 2008 Mumbai attacks Candlelight vigils at the Gateway of India in Mumbai Indians criticised their political leaders after the attacks, saying that their ineptness was partly responsible. The Times of India commented on its front page that ""Our politicians fiddle as innocents die."" [ 254 ] Political reactions in Mumbai and India included a range of resignations and political changes, including the resignations of Minister for Home Affairs Shivraj Patil , [ 23 ] Chief Minister Vilasrao Deshmukh [ 255 ] and deputy chief minister R. R. Patil [ 256 ] for controversial reactions to the attack including taking the former's son and Bollywood director Ram Gopal Varma to tour the damaged Taj Hotel and the latter's remarks that the attacks were not a big deal in such a large city. Indian Muslims condemned the attacks and refused to bury the attackers. Groups of Muslims marched against the attacks [ 257 ] and mosques observed silence. Prominent Muslim personalities such as Bollywood actor Aamir Khan appealed to their community members in the country to observe Eid al-Adha as a day of mourning on 9 December. [ 258 ] The business establishment also reacted, with changes to transport, and requests for an increase in self-defence capabilities. [ 259 ] The attacks also triggered a chain of citizens' movements across India such as the India Today Group's ""War Against Terror"" campaign. There were vigils held across all of India with candles and placards commemorating the victims of the attacks. [ 260 ] The NSG commandos based in Delhi also met criticism for taking ten hours to reach the three sites under attack. [ 261 ] [ 262 ] Citizens gather outside The Taj Mahal Palace Hotel demanding the government take action. International reaction for the attacks was widespread, with many countries and international organisations condemning the attacks and expressing their condolences to the civilian victims. Many important personalities around the world also condemned the attacks. [ 263 ] Media coverage highlighted the use of social media and social networking tools, including Twitter and Flickr , in spreading information about the attacks. In addition, many Indian bloggers offered live textual coverage of the attacks. [ 264 ] A map of the attacks was set up by a web journalist using Google Maps . [ 265 ] [ 266 ] The New York Times , in July 2009, described the event as ""what may be the most well-documented terrorist attack anywhere"". [ 267 ] In November 2010, families of American victims of the attacks filed a lawsuit in Brooklyn, New York, naming Lt. Gen. Ahmed Shuja Pasha , chief of the ISI, as being complicit in the Mumbai attacks. On 22 September 2011, the attack on the American Embassy in Afghanistan was attributed to Pakistan via cell phone records identical to the attacks in Mumbai, also linked to Pakistan. [ citation needed ] Trials [ edit ] Kasab's trial [ edit ] Kasab 's trial was delayed due to legal issues, as many Indian lawyers were unwilling to represent him. A Mumbai Bar Association passed a resolution proclaiming that none of its members would represent Kasab. However, the Chief Justice of India stated that Kasab needed a lawyer for a fair trial. A lawyer for Kasab was eventually found, but was replaced due to a conflict of interest. [ 268 ] On 25 February 2009, Indian investigators filed an 11,000-page chargesheet , formally charging Kasab with murder, conspiracy, and waging war against India among other charges. [ 269 ] Kasab's trial began on 23 March 2009, and he pled not guilty on 6 May 2009. [ 270 ] On 10 June 2009, Devika Rotawan , a child who had been shot in her leg during the attack, identified Kasab as one of the attackers during her testimony. [ 271 ] [ 272 ] He pled guilty on 20 July 2009. [ 270 ] The judge found many of the 86 charges were not addressed in his confession, and therefore the trial continued 23 July 2009. [ 270 ] Kasab initially apologised for the attacks and said he deserved the death penalty for his crimes, but on 18 December 2009, retracted his confession, and said he had been forced by police to make his confession. [ 270 ] Kasab was convicted of all 86 charges on 3 May 2010. [ 270 ] He was found guilty of murder for directly killing seven people, conspiracy to commit murder for the deaths of the 164 people killed in the three-day terror siege, waging war against India, causing terror, and of conspiracy to murder two high-ranking police officers. On 6 May 2010, he was sentenced to death by hanging. [ 273 ] [ 274 ] [ 275 ] [ 276 ] However, he appealed his sentence at high court. On 21 February 2011, the Bombay High Court upheld the death sentence of Kasab, dismissing his appeal. [ 277 ] On 29 August 2012, the Indian Supreme Court upheld the death sentence for Kasab. The court stated, ""We are left with no option but to award death penalty. The primary and foremost offence committed by Kasab is waging war against the Government of India"". [ 278 ] The verdict followed 10 weeks of appeal hearings, and was decided by a two-judge Supreme Court panel, which was led by Judge Aftab Alam. The panel rejected arguments that Kasab was denied a free and fair trial. [ 279 ] Kasab filed a mercy petition with the President of India, which was rejected on 5 November. Kasab was hanged in Pune's Yerwada jail in secret on 21 November 2012 at 7:30 am named as operation 'X'. The Indian embassy in Islamabad informed the Pakistan government about Kasab's hanging through a letter. Pakistan refused to take the letter, which was then faxed to them. His family in Pakistan was sent news of his hanging via a courier. [ 280 ] In Pakistan [ edit ] Indian and Pakistani police exchanged DNA evidence, photographs and items found with the attackers to piece together a detailed portrait of the Mumbai plot. Police in Pakistan arrested seven people, including Hammad Amin Sadiq, a homoeopathic pharmacist, who arranged bank accounts and secured supplies. Sadiq and six others began their formal trial on 3 October 2009 in Pakistan. Indian authorities said the prosecution stopped well short of top Lashkar leaders. [ 281 ] In November 2009, Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said that Pakistan had not done enough to bring the perpetrators of the attacks to justice. [ 282 ] An eight-member commission comprising defence lawyers, prosecutors and a court official was allowed to travel to India on 15 March 2013 to gather evidence for the prosecution of seven suspects linked to the 2008 Mumbai attacks. However, the defence lawyers were barred from cross-examining the four prosecution witnesses in the case including Ajmal Kasab. [ 283 ] [ 284 ] On the eve of the first anniversary of 26/11, a Pakistani anti-terror court formally charged seven accused, including LeT operations commander Zaki ur Rehman Lakhvi . However, the actual trial started on 5 May 2012. The Pakistani court conducting trial of Mumbai attacks accused, reserved its judgement on the application filed by Lakhvi, challenging the report of the judicial panel, to 17 July 2012. [ 285 ] On 17 July 2012, the court refused to take the findings of the Pakistani judicial commission as part of the evidence. However, it ruled that if a new agreement, which allows the panel's examination of witnesses, is reached, the prosecution may make an application for sending the panel to Mumbai. [ 286 ] The Indian Government, upset over the court ruling, however, contended that evidence collected by the Pakistani judicial panel has evidential value to punish all those involved in the attack. [ 287 ] On 21 September 2013, a Pakistani judicial commission arrived in India to carry out the investigation and to cross examine the witnesses. This is the second such visit: the one in March 2012 was not a success [ 288 ] as its report was rejected by an anti-terrorism court in Pakistan due to lack of evidence. In the United States [ edit ] The LeT operative David Headley (born Daood Sayed Gilani) in his testimony before a Chicago federal court during co-accused Tahawwur Rana 's trial revealed that Mumbai Chabad House was added to the list of targets for surveillance given by his Inter Services Intelligence handler Major Iqbal , though the Oberoi Hotel , one of the sites attacked, was not originally on the list. [ 289 ] On 10 June 2011, Tahawwur Rana was acquitted of plotting the 2008 Mumbai attacks but was held guilty on two other charges. [ 290 ] He was sentenced to 14 years in federal prison on 17 January 2013. [ 291 ] In May 2023, a US court approved his extradition to India where he is sought for his involvement in the 2008 Mumbai terror attacks. [ 292 ] David Headley pleaded guilty to 12 counts related to the attacks, including conspiracy to commit murder in India and aiding and abetting in the murder of six Americans. On 23 January 2013, he was sentenced to 35 years in federal prison. His plea that he not be extradited to India, Pakistan or Denmark was accepted. [ 293 ] Memorials [ edit ] On the first anniversary of the event, the state paid homage to the victims of the attack. Force One —a new security force created by the Maharashtra government—staged a parade from Nariman Point to Chowpatty. Other memorials and candlelight vigils were also organised at the various locations where the attacks occurred. [ 294 ] Mumbai 26/11 Attacks memorial bearing the names of people killed at Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus . On the second anniversary of the event, homage was again paid to the victims. [ 295 ] On the 10th anniversary of the 26/11 Mumbai terror attacks, Nariman House, one of the several establishments that were targeted by the Lashkar-e-Taiba terrorists, were to be declared a memorial and renamed as Nariman Light House. [ 296 ] The Indian Express group hosts an annual memorial event, 26/11 – Stories of Strength, in Mumbai to pay homage to those killed in the ghastly terror attacks in the city in 2008. [ 297 ] [ 298 ] The memorial event started in 2016, is now organised at the Gateway of India and brings forth the inspiring stories of courage and strength of more than 100 survivors that the Indian Express has interviewed over the past decade. Actor Amitabh Bachchan has been the brand ambassador for the event over the years.

It is an account of the 2008 attacks on The Taj Mahal Palace Hotel in Mumbai, India, during the night of 26 November 2008. The book was first published by Penguin Books in 2013. [ 326 ] In 2014, Black Tornado: The Three Sieges of Mumbai 26/11 [ 327 ] [ 328 ] was published by Indian journalist Sandeep Unnnithan, a non-fiction book, presented a blow-by-blow account of the terrorist strike and how the siege of Mumbai was thwarted by India's security forces. The book covers the heroic efforts of Marine Commandos of Indian Navy as well as an ill-equipped yet valiant Mumbai Police . But its primary focus is on the 51 Special Action Group of National Security Guards , commanded by the decorated Indian Army Special Forces officer, then Colonel, now Brigadier . Sunil Sheoran Sena Medal (Bar). The book delves into the reasons for the delayed arrival of the NSG, including incredible facts like the then Home Minister of India, Shivraj Patil , wanted to fly in the NSG aircraft and came 1 hour late to board the plane which inturn delayed the NSG's arrival into the city and that the then Southern Army Commander, Lt. General. Noble Thamburaj, notoriously toured the Taj Mahal Palace Hotel with his wife while the NSG operation was still on. It was adapted into the web series State of Siege: 26/11 (2020). [ 329 ] [ 330 ] Aziz Burney wrote a book titled 26/11: RSS ki Saazish? (""26/11: An RSS conspiracy?"") hinting that Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh was somehow linked to the attack and launched the book in presence of Congress leader Digvijaya Singh . [ 331 ] Later as RSS filed a case against him, he had to apologise for it. [ 332 ] [ 333 ] In his 2020 memoirs, Let Me Say It Now , former IPS officer Rakesh Maria , who was given the responsibility of investigating the attacks and personally interrogated Ajmal Kasab , revealed the extent to which terrorists had gone to ensure their bodies would be mis-identified as Hindus, to lend credence to the narrative that the attack was the handiwork of Hindu extremists, and thus provide the Pakistani authorities with plausible deniability . According to Maria, Lashkar-e-Taiba wanted Kasab to be killed as a Bengaluru resident named ‘Samir Dinesh Chaudhari’, with a ""red (sacred) thread"" tied around his wrist to portray the attack as a case of ‘Hindu terror’, but their plan apparently did not succeed and the police nabbed Kasab. LeT had even given each terrorist a fake identity card listing an Indian address, to further strengthen the circumstantial narrative. If everything went according to plan, Kasab would have died as Chaudhari and the media would have blamed 'Hindu terrorists' for the attack. Kasab, in his confessional account, acknowledged this plot, as did David Coleman Headley , who corroborated this account by confirming that the sacred threads to be worn around the terrorists' wrists to identify them as Hindus, were procured from Mumbai's Siddhivinayak Temple .

A long-standing movement advocating for greater political rights for the Sikh community had previously existed in the Indian state of Punjab , and in 1973, Sikh activists presented the Indian government with the Anandpur Sahib Resolution , a list of demands for greater autonomy for Punjab. The resolution was rejected by the Indian government. In July 1982, Harchand Singh Longowal , the president of the Sikh political party Shiromani Akali Dal , invited Bhindranwale, who was wanted by authorities, to take up residence in the Golden Temple to evade arrest. [ 25 ] : 332 [ 26 ] Bhindranwale had organized killer squads to eliminate supposed enemies of Sikhism. [ 27 ] From the Harmandir Sahib complex, Bhindranwale orchestrated militants to kill hundreds of Hindus, and used terrorism to evoke fear among Hindus, hoping to incite their mass flight from Punjab. [ 28 ] [ 29 ] [ 30 ] On 1 June 1984, after negotiations with the militants failed, Indian prime minister Indira Gandhi ordered the army to launch Operation Blue Star in haste, attacking the Golden Temple and scores of other Sikh temples and sites across Punjab which included killing civilians and devotees too. [ 31 ] The military underestimated the firepower possessed by the Sikh militants, whose armaments included Chinese-made rocket-propelled grenade launchers and ammunition with armour-piercing capabilities. Hoping to avoid damage to the holy site, Indian forces unsuccessfully assaulted the temple using light weaponry and quickly resorted to using heavy weapons, including tanks , helicopters and artillery to dislodge the well-fortified Sikh militants. Combat devolved into protracted urban warfare, with the Indian forces committing significant forces to slowly gain ground. Eventually, the Sikh militants ran out of most of their ammunition on 6 June, and by 10 June fighting had largely ceased, with the Indian forces in control of the complex. The Indian government attributed high civilian casualties to Sikh militants using pilgrims trapped inside the temple as human shields . [ 32 ] However, Indian forces were aware that civilians were present inside, and the operation began on a Sikh religious day, the martyrdom day of Guru Arjan Dev , when many worshippers would be present. Many civilians were subject to extrajudicial killings by the military during the operation. [ 33 ] [ 34 ] [ 35 ] [ 36 ] [ 37 ] The military action in the temple complex was criticized by Sikhs worldwide, who interpreted it as an assault on the Sikh religion and the entire Sikh community. [ 38 ] Five months after the operation, on 31 October 1984, Indira Gandhi was assassinated in retaliation by two Sikhs, Satwant Singh and Beant Singh . [ 26 ] Her party, the Indian National Congress , utilized public outcry over her death, leading to the 1984 anti-Sikh riots led by Congress workers and angered mobs, which resulted in the deaths of thousands of Sikh civilians. [ 39 ] Despite accomplishing its stated objectives, the operation has been described as ""disastrous"" for the Indian military and state. [ 7 ] [ 40 ] It greatly exacerbated tensions between the Indian government and the Sikh community, many of whom had been demanding a separate state . Meanwhile, the anti-Sikh riots of 1984 turned a series of police operations into widespread sectarian violence. The brutality of the operation and high civilian casualties spawned an insurgency in Punjab, which would be waged by Sikh militants for over a decade. The operation has been used as a case study highlighting the importance of respecting religious and cultural sensitivity prior to launching military operations. The complex would later be raided twice more as part of Operation Black Thunder I and II , with both operations having little to no civilian casualties or damage to the Temple despite larger amounts of militants than Operation Blue Star. [ 7 ] Background In the years leading up to the operation, there was a significant build-up in agitation for greater autonomy for the Sikh community. Economic and social pressures driven by the Green Revolution led many young Sikh men to support varying degrees of self-determination for Sikhs and Punjab, with many even advocating independence from India. The introduction of mechanised agricultural techniques led to uneven distribution of wealth in Punjab. Industrial development did not occur at the same pace of agricultural development in Punjab, as the Indian government was reluctant to set up heavy industries in Punjab due to its status as a high-risk border state with Pakistan. [ 41 ] Meanwhile, a rapid increase in higher education opportunities without adequate rise in jobs resulted in an increase in unemployment among educated youth. [ 42 ] The resulting unemployed young Sikhs were drawn to militant groups, which formed the backbone of increasing militancy. [ 43 ] In the 1950s, the Akali Dal party launched the Punjabi Suba movement , demanding a new state within India with a majority of Punjabi speaking people, out of undivided East Punjab under the leadership of Sant Fateh Singh . [ 44 ] This movement resulted in fraught relations with the union government, and the Golden Temple , the holiest site in Sikhism, was raided in 1955, and many of the movement's leaders were arrested. In 1966, after negotiations, the present Punjab state with a Sikh majority was formed. The Akali Dal came to power in the new Punjab state in March 1967, [ 45 ] but early governments didn't last long due to internal conflicts and power struggles within the party. Later, the party strengthened and party governments completed their full term and eventually came to play a major role in the developments to come.

[ 46 ] The resolution was rejected by the Indian government. Activist Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale then joined the Akali Dal, and launched the Dharam Yudh Morcha movement in 1982, in a bid to urge the Indian government to implement the Anandpur Sahib Resolution. [ 47 ] Prelude Golden Temple with Akal Takht on the right, photographed in 2006 Following the events of the 1978 Sikh-Nirankari clashes and the Dharam Yudh Morcha, Bhindranwale had risen to prominence in Sikh political circles with his policy of getting the Anandpur Resolution passed, failing which he wanted to declare a separate country of Khalistan as a homeland for Sikhs. [ 48 ] The resolution declared its goals within the context of remaining within the federal union of India, and leaving the powers of foreign relations, defence, currency, and general communications subject to the jurisdiction of the Indian central government. Harchand Singh Longwal , the leader of the Akali Dal, stated, ""[let] us make it clear once and for all that the Sikhs have no designs to get away from India in any manner. What they simply want is that they should be allowed to live within India as Sikhs, free from all direct and indirect interference and tampering with their religious way of life. Undoubtedly, the Sikhs have the same nationality as other Indians."" [ 49 ] Nonetheless, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi , viewed the Anandpur Sahib Resolution as a secessionist document. [ 50 ] Initial Indian intelligence situation The reluctance of the central government to deescalate the situation or offer major concessions has often been attributed to foreign influence. In the early 1980s, one of the main aims of Soviet KGB active measures with regards to India was to manufacture evidence that the CIA and Pakistani intelligence were behind the growth of Sikh separatism in Punjab. [ 51 ] In 1981, the Soviets launched Operation Kontakt, which was centered around a forged document purporting to contain details of the weapons and money provided by the Pakistani Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) to Sikh militants who wanted to create an independent country. [ 51 ] According to agent reports, the level of anxiety in the Indian embassy in Islamabad regarding Pakistani support for Sikh separatists indicated that Operation Kontakt was successfully achieving its goals of creating an alarmist effect. [ 51 ] The Soviets used a new recruit in the New Delhi residency named ""Agent S"" who was close to Indira Gandhi as a major channel for providing her misleading information. [ 51 ] Agent S provided Indira Gandhi with false documents purporting to show Pakistani involvement in the Khalistan conspiracy. [ 51 ] In November 1982, Yuri Andropov , the leader of the Soviet Union, approved a proposal to fabricate Pakistani intelligence documents detailing ISI plans to foment religious disturbances in Punjab and promote the creation of Khalistan as an independent Sikh state. [ 52 ] The KGB became confident that it could continue to deceive Indira Gandhi indefinitely with fabricated reports of CIA and Pakistani conspiracies against her. [ 52 ] The Soviets persuaded Rajiv Gandhi during a visit to Moscow in 1983 that the CIA was engaged in subversion in the Punjab. [ 52 ] When Rajiv Gandhi returned to India, he declared this to be true. [ 52 ] Indira Gandhi's decision to move troops into the Punjab was based on her taking seriously the disinformation provided by the Soviets regarding secret CIA support for the Sikhs. [ 53 ] In 2005, Christopher Andrew concluded that the KGB was ultimately responsible for Indira Gandhi and others in the central government exaggerating the threats posed by the Sikh militants, Pakistan, and the CIA. [ 53 ] The KGB role in facilitating Operation Blue Star was acknowledged by Subramanian Swamy in 1992, who stated, [the] 1984 Operation Bluestar became necessary because of the vast disinformation against Sant Bhindranwale by the KGB, and repeated inside Parliament by the Congress Party of India. [ 54 ] In addition to Soviet influence, India was also aware of actual Pakistani influence and armament operations among the Sikh militants. According to anthropologist Cynthia Keppley Mahmood, Kashmiri fighters were present in the Golden Temple complex in 1984; both the Punjab and Kashmir insurgencies shared links with the Pakistan secret service whose aegis provided arms and training. [ 55 ] Militant fortifications and initial violence Following the 1978 clashes , Bhindranwale's followers had begun keeping firearms and fortified the gurdwara that served as the headquarters of the Damdami Taksal religious center. [ 56 ] In July 1982, Harchand Singh Longowal invited Bhindranwale to take up residence in the Golden Temple complex. He called Bhindranwale ""our stave to beat the government"". [ 25 ] : 337 On 19 July 1982, Bhindranwale and approximately 200 armed militants occupied the Guru Nanak Niwas, a guest house for pilgrims, [ 57 ] within the precincts of the Golden Temple complex. Bhindranwale had effectively made the complex his headquarters. [ 56 ] From there he met and was interviewed by international television crews. [ 58 ] On 23 April 1983, Punjab Police Deputy Inspector General A. S. Atwal was shot dead by a gunman in the complex as he left the complex. [ 59 ] The following day, Longowal accused Bhindranwale of involvement in the murder. [ 60 ] [ 61 ] The Punjab Assembly noted that the murder in the temple premises confirmed the charges that the extremists were being sheltered and given active support in religious buildings around the Golden Temple complex, especially the Guru Nanak Niwas. [ 62 ] : 393 [ 61 ] After the murder of six Hindu bus passengers in the 1983 Dhilwan Bus Massacre , President's rule was imposed in Punjab state. [ 63 ] This led to increasing communal tension between Sikhs and Hindus as Hindu mobs in Karnal , Haryana murdered 8 Sikhs and set fire to a gurdwara on 19 February 1984. [ 64 ] Continued occupation of the Golden Temple complex by Sikh militants A picture of the rebuilt Akal Takht in 2013. Bhindranwale and his followers occupied Akal Takht in December 1983. During debate in the Parliament of India members of both houses demanded the arrest of Bhindranwale. Sensing a prospect of his arrest from the hostel premises, he convinced SGPC president Tohra to set up his headquarter in Akal Takht (a shrine representing the temporal power of God) in the Golden Temple. [ 62 ] : 131 The temple high priest protested this move as a sacrilege since no Guru or leader ever resided in the Akal Takht on the floor above Granth Sahib , but Tohra agreed to Bhindranwale's demand to prevent his arrest. [ 62 ] : 131 On 15 December 1983, Bhindranwale was asked to move out of Guru Nanak Niwas house by members of the Babbar Khalsa , who opposed Bhindranwale, [ 65 ] who acted with Longowal's support. Longowal by now feared for his own safety. [ 66 ] Tohra convinced the high priest to allow Bhindranwale to reside on the first floor of Akal Takht, as he had nowhere to go to avoid arrest. [ 62 ] : 131 He said that he had to move to Akal Takht as Morcha director Longowal was negotiating with the government for his arrest. [ 62 ] : 131 The government said Bhindranwale and his followers had made the Golden Temple complex an armoury [ 67 ] and headquarters, [ 66 ] [ verification needed ] though amassing arms and usage as a base for waging war was part of the tradition of most historical gurdwaras, which display weapons caches used by the Gurus, depicting the centrality of Sikh sites to their struggles. [ 68 ] A few leaders raised their voice against Bhindranwale in the Akal Takht complex and other gurdwaras across the state. [ clarification needed ] Among the prominent ones was Giani Partap Singh, a spiritual leader and former Jathedar of the Akal Takht, who criticized Bhindranwale for keeping guns in the Akal Takht. Partap was later killed along with other dissenters including Harbans Singh Manchanda, the Delhi Sikh Gurudwara Management Committee president, [ 69 ] Niranjan Singh, the Granthi of Gurudwara Toot Sahib, Granthi Jarnail Singh of Valtoha and Granthi Surat Singh of Majauli. [ citation needed ] The militants were able to claim safe haven in the Golden Temple due to the whole or partial support received by them from key Sikh religious leaders and institutions such as the SGPC , AISSF and Jathedar (head) of the Akal Takht . The support was either voluntary or forced by using violence or threat of violence. [ 68 ] Negotiations In January 1984, India's secret service Research & Analysis Wing (RAW) prepared a covert plan codenamed Operation Sundown involving special forces to abduct Bhindranwale from the Golden Temple complex. [ 70 ] A RAW unit was formed to rehearse Operation Sundown in the Sarsawa Air Force Base in Uttar Pradesh , but the operation never materialized due to Indira Gandhi's rejection. The government sent a team led by Narasimha Rao to try to convince Bhindranwale to back out, but he was adamant. [ 71 ] [ 72 ] The negotiations failed and the law and order situation in Punjab continued to deteriorate. [ 71 ] Indira Gandhi tried to persuade the Akalis to support her in the arrest of Bhindranwale peacefully. These talks ended up being futile. [ 71 ] In the days before the assault, government representatives met with Bhindranwale in a last ditch effort to negotiate a truce. The Sikhs would withdraw, believing they had seen a commando unit move into the city. [ 73 ] Bhindranwale warned of a backlash by the Sikh community in the event of an armed assault on the Golden Temple. [ 74 ] On 26 May, Tohra informed the government that he had failed to get Bhindranwale to agree to a peaceful resolution of the crisis, and that Bhindranwale was no longer under anyone's control. [ 75 ] Faced with imminent army action and with Harchand Singh Longowal abandoning him, Bhindranwale declared, ""This bird is alone. There are many hunters after it."" [ 75 ] In his final interview to Subhash Kirpekar, Bhindranwale stated that Sikhs can neither live in India nor with India. [ 62 ] : 555 Indira Gandhi then gave her permission to initiate Operation Blue Star on the recommendation of Army Chief Arun Shridhar Vaidya . She was apparently led to believe and had assumed that the operation would not involve any civilian casualties. [ 76 ] The assumption was that, when confronted, Bhindranwale would surrender to the army. [ 62 ] Preparations Fortification of Golden Temple An arsenal had been created within the Akal Takht over a period of several months. It was reported that trucks engaged for kar seva (religious service) and bringing in supplies for the daily langar were smuggling in guns and ammunition. The police never attempted to check these vehicles entering the Golden Temple, [ weasel words ] on instructions from superiors. During a random check one such truck was stopped and many Sten guns and ammunition were found. The Indian government White Paper alleged that after Operation Blue Star it was found that the militants had set up a grenade manufacturing facility, and a workshop for the fabrication of Sten guns inside the Temple Complex. [ 77 ] However, the allegations of the militants being in possession of weapon workshops was never made prior to Operation Blue Star, and only after, with only the Army making these statements. [ 78 ] The statements of multiple civilian eyewitnesses instead were consistent that the militants were a small number of men and had limited arms that were used sparingly. [ 78 ] The Harmandir Sahib compound and some of the surrounding houses were fortified under the guidance of Major General Shabeg Singh , who had joined Bhindranwale's group after dismissal from the army. During their occupation of Akal Takht, Bhindranwale's group had begun fortifying the building. The Statesman reported that light machine guns and semi-automatic rifles were known to have been brought into the compound, [ 79 ] and strategically placed to defend against an armed assault on the complex. The modern weapons later found inside the temple complex indicated that foreign elements were involved. The heavier weapons were found to have Pakistani or Chinese markings on them. [ 80 ] According to Lt. General J.S. Arora only 60 self-loading riles were foreign made. The rest were Indian. He also said that there were no medium machine guns and only two RPGs. Arora says that the arsenal was not truly sophisticated. [ 81 ] : 55 A Lt. Colonel part of the Operation later revealed that militants only had 4 light machine gun magazines. According to him a single light machine gun carries 12 magazines. He revealed that the main gun that was kept and used by militants was AK-47s. [ 81 ] : 55–56 Holes were smashed through the marble walls of Akal takht to create gun positions . Walls were broken to allow entry points to the tiled courtyards. Secure machine gun nests were created. All of these positions were protected by sandbags and newly made brick walls. The windows and arches of Akal Takht were blocked with bricks and sandbags . Sandbags were placed on the turrets. Every strategically significant building of the temple complex, apart from the Harmandir Sahib in the center, had been fortified in a similar manner and allegedly defaced. The fortifications also included seventeen private houses in the residential area near the Temple. [ citation needed ] All the high rise buildings and towers near the temple complex were occupied. The militants manning these vantage points were in wireless contact with Shabeg Singh in Akal Takht. [ 82 ] [ 62 ] : 551 Under the military leadership of Major General Singh, ex-army veterans and deserters had trained Bhindranwale's men. [ citation needed ] The militants in the complex were anticipating an attack by government troops. The defences in the complex were created with the purpose of stalling an assault, giving time to provoke Sikhs in the villages and encourage them to march en masse towards the Golden Temple in support of the militants. Sufficient food to last a month was stocked in the complex. [ 82 ] [ 83 ] During this period police and security forces stationed around the temple complex were allowed only within 200 yards. This was to avoid the 'desecration' of the temple by their presence. The security forces were prevented by the politicians from taking action in enforcing the law. Even self-defence from the militants was made difficult. On 14 February 1984, a police post near the entrance of the Temple was attacked by a group of militants. Six fully armed policemen were captured and taken inside. After twenty four hours the police responded and sent in a senior police officer for negotiation. He asked Bhindranwale to release his men, along with their weapons. Bhindranwale agreed and delivered the dead body of one of the hostages who had been killed. Later the remaining five policemen were released alive, but their weapons were kept. [ 62 ] : 119 The fortifications of the temple denied the army the possibility of commando operations. The buildings were close together and had labyrinthine passages all under the control of the militants. Militants in the temple premises had access to langars, food supplies, and water from the Sarovar (temple pond). Militants were well stocked with weapons and ammunition. Any siege under these circumstances would have been long and difficult. The option of laying down a long siege was ruled out by the army due to the risk of emotionally aroused villagers marching to the temple and clashing with the army. The negotiated settlement had already been rejected by Bhindranwale and the government decided to raid the temple. [ 62 ] : 515 Rise in militant incidents Main article: Punjab insurgency Police methods normally used on common criminals were used on protesters during the Dharam Yudh Morcha , creating state repression affecting a very large segment of Punjab's population. Retaliatory violence came from a section of the Sikh population, widening the scope of the conflict and creating fresh motives for Sikh youth to turn to insurgency. [ 84 ] The concept of Khalistan was still vague even while the complex was fortified under the influence of former Sikh army officials alienated by government actions who now advised Bhindranwale, Major General Shabeg Singh and retired Major General and Brigadier Mohinder Singh, and at that point the concept was still not directly connected with the movement he headed. [ 84 ] In other parts of Punjab, a ""state of chaos and repressive police methods"" combined to create ""a mood of overwhelming anger and resentment in the Sikh masses against the authorities"", making Bhindranwale even more popular, and demands of independence gain currency, even amongst moderates and Sikh intellectuals. [ 84 ] On 12 May 1984, Ramesh Chander, son of Lala Jagat Narain and editor of media house Hind Samachar group, was murdered by pro-Bhindranwale militants. In addition, seven editors and seven news hawkers and newsagents were killed in a planned attack on the freedom of media house, to cripple it financially. Punjab Police had to provide protection for the entire distribution staff. [ 85 ] Violent incidents including arson, bombings, and shootings increased over the following months. [ 86 ] The total number of deaths was 410 in violent incidents and riots, and 1,180 people were injured. [ 62 ] : 147 The government never provided evidence of the supposedly planned massacre of Hindus that triggered Operation Blue Star, although the pace of attacks was increasing. [ 62 ] : 148 Congress member of parliament Amarjit Kaur, who referred to the Akali Dal as ""the enemy within"" and who had opposed the creation of the Punjabi Suba , alleged that Bhindranwale wanted to start a civil war between Hindus and Sikhs. [ 35 ] Meanwhile, the number of killings had been rising all over the state, with sometimes more than a dozen a day. [ citation needed ] On 2 June in the last 24 hours before the announcement of the operation 23 people were killed. [ 62 ] : 408 In June 1984, the army was called out to help the civil administration in Punjab in response to a request from the Punjab Governor, B. D. Pande , ""in view of the escalating violence by terrorists in Punjab. "" [ 87 ] On 2 June Operation Blue Star was initiated to flush out the militants from the Golden Temple. [ 62 ] : 516 The Khalistanis had started the movement to drive Hindus out of certain areas to make way for Sikhs coming in from other states. [ 88 ] Due to the increased incidents of religious violence, an exchange of population had already started in Punjab. New Khalistani currency was being printed and distributed. [ 32 ] By May 1984, the establishment of an independent Khalistan seemed imminent, as the Indian government had ""received intelligence"" that Pakistan had been supporting the militants with arms and money, and if Khalistan declared its independence there was the risk of Pakistan recognizing the new country and sending the Pakistani Army into Indian Punjab to protect it. [ 32 ] However, the Indian government had been the target of disinformation by the Russian KGB intelligence agency, which had sought to implicate Pakistans' Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) in the Khalistan movement by spreading forged documents and reports to the Indian government. [ 51 ] Army preparations According to the then- Vice Chief of the Army Staff , Srinivas Kumar Sinha the army had begun preparations for an attack on the Golden Temple 18 months prior. [ 89 ] Two months prior to the Operation the Air Force had helicopters flying above the temple taking photographs. The Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) had surrounded the temple two months prior to the Operation. [ 81 ] : 65 Operation Map of the Harmandir Sahib Complex Operation Blue Star was launched to remove Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale and his followers who had sought cover in the Amritsar Harmandir Sahib Complex. On 3 June, a 36-hour curfew was imposed on the state of Punjab with all methods of communication and public travel suspended. [ 2 ] : 54 The electricity supply was also interrupted, creating a total blackout and cutting off the state from the rest of the world. Complete media censorship was enforced. [ 2 ] : 81–82 The army stormed Harmandir Sahib on the night of 5 June under the command of Major-General Kuldip Singh Brar . The forces had full control of Harmandir Sahib by the morning of 7 June. There were casualties among the army, civilians, and militants. Sikh leaders Bhindranwale and Shabeg Singh were killed in the operation. [ 90 ] Generals The armed Sikhs within the Harmandir Sahib were led by Bhindranwale, former Maj. Gen. Shabeg Singh , and Amrik Singh , the President of the All India Sikh Students Federation from Damdami Taksal. General Arun Shridhar Vaidya was the Chief of the Indian Army . Lt. Gen. Krishaswamy Sundarji , GOC Western Command , planned and coordinated Operation Blue Star. [ 91 ] From the Indian Army Maj. Gen. Kuldip Singh Brar had command of the operation. On 31 May he had been summoned from Meerut and asked to lead the operation to remove the militants from the temple. Brar was a Jat Sikh , the same caste as Bhindranwale, and was also acquainted with Shabeg Singh, having been his student at the Indian Military Academy at Dehradun . [ 82 ] Among the six generals leading the operation, four were Sikhs. [ 92 ] : 175 The army operation was further subdivided along two subcategories: [ 93 ] Operation Metal : to take out the militants including Bhindranwale from the Golden Temple complex. Brar's 9 Infantry Division was deputed for this. Operation Shop : to attack extremist areas throughout the Punjab state and deal with remaining militants in the countryside. In addition, the army carried out Operation Woodrose, in which units were deployed to the border areas, replacing the pickets routinely held by the paramilitary Border Security Force (BSF). The border pickets were held in at least company strength. [ 93 ] 1 June On 1 June 1984 the Indian security forces fired into various buildings with the goal of assessing the training of the militants. [ 13 ] [ 94 ] Eyewitness testimony of pilgrims inside the temple complex state that the Harmandir Sahib was fired on initially by security forces on 1 June and not 5 June as reported by the army. [ 94 ] The firing began at about 12:40 pm and went until about 8:40 pm It was by the CRPF and they used medium machine guns , light machine guns and rifles. [ 95 ] It resulted in the main shrine of the Golden Temple sustaining 34 bullet holes. [ 13 ] The action claimed the lives of eight pilgrims, including a woman and a child, inside the temple complex and injured 25 others. [ 13 ] Devinder Singh Duggal, who was in-charge of the Sikh Reference Library located inside of the Temple complex and an eye-witness to Operation Blue Star, stated that the militants were given instructions to not fire until the army or security forces entered the temple. [ 13 ] [ 96 ] Duggal stated, ""...when I heard in the news bulletin that there was unprovoked firing from inside the Temple, but that the security forces showed extreme restrain and did not fire a single shot, I was surprised at this naked lie."" [ 96 ] The deaths of at least three of the pilgrims was confirmed by the eyewitness testimony of a female Sikh student who had dressed their wounds and who later witnessed their deaths in Guru Nanak Nivas. [ 96 ] According to Kirpal Singh eleven were killed in the shooting. [ 95 ] Furthermore, Duggal stated that on 2 June 1984 a BBC team, including journalist Mark Tully , were taken around the Temple and shown 34 holes, some of them as big as three inches in diameter, caused by the bullets on all sides of the temple. [ 97 ] Tully noted, ""The CRPF firing took place four days before the army actually entered the Temple."" [ 97 ] 2 June The army had already sealed the international border from Kashmir to Ganga Nagar, Rajasthan . At least seven divisions of troops were deployed in villages of Punjab. The soldiers began taking control of the city of Amritsar from the paramilitary. A young Sikh officer posing as a pilgrim was sent in to reconnoitre the temple. He spent an hour in the complex noting defensive preparations. Plans were made to clear vantage points occupied by militants outside the complex before the main assault. Patrols were also sent to study these locations. [ 82 ] As the Indian army was sealing off exits out of Amritsar, it continued to allow pilgrims to enter the temple complex. [ 98 ] All outgoing trains from Amritsar had left by noon and other trains were cancelled. [ 98 ] The CRPF outside the temple had been replaced by the army who were taking into custody any visitors leaving the temple. [ 98 ] A pilgrim who survived the assault stated that he did not leave the temple because of the detention of visitors by the army. [ 98 ] By nightfall media and the press were gagged and rail, road and air services in Punjab were suspended. Foreigners and non-resident Indians were denied entry. General Gauri Shankar was appointed as security advisor to the Governor of Punjab. The water and electricity supply was cut off. [ 99 ] [ 66 ] [ 100 ] 3 June According to an All Sikhs Student Federation member, 10,000 people had come from outside including many women and 4,000 of them were young people. [ 98 ] The Shiromani Gurdwara Prabhandak Committee estimates that approximately 10,000 to 15,000 pilgrims had come from Punjab's cities and villages to attend the Gurparab. [ 34 ] Along with the pilgrims were 1,300 Akali workers led by Jathedar Nachattar Singh who had come to participate in the Dharam Yudh Morcha and to court arrest. [ 101 ] [ 35 ] The Akali jathas who were also present consisted of about 200 women, 18 children and about 1,100 men and were also forced to stay inside the temple complex. [ 98 ] [ 35 ] Those who were inside were not allowed to go out after 10:00 pm on 3 June because of the curfew placed by the military. [ 98 ] In addition, as of 3 June the pilgrims who had entered the temple in the days prior were unaware that Punjab had been placed under curfew. [ 101 ] Thousands of pilgrims and hundreds of Akali workers had been allowed to collect inside the Temple complex without any warning either of the sudden curfew or imminent Army attack. [ 101 ] In the night the curfew was re-imposed with the army and para-military patrolling all of Punjab . The army sealed off all routes of ingress and exit around the temple complex. [ 62 ] : 147 Army units led by Indian Army Lt. Gen Kuldip Singh Brar surrounded the temple complex on 3 June 1984. Just before the commencement of the operation, Lt. Gen Brar addressed the soldiers: The action is not against the Sikhs or the Sikh religion; it is against terrorism. If there is anyone amongst them, who have strong religious sentiments or other reservations, and do not wish to take part in the operation he can opt out, and it will not be held against him. — Kuldip Singh Brar , [ 102 ] However, no one opted out and that included many ""Sikh officers, junior commissioned officers and other ranks"". [ 102 ] 4 June Akal Takhat, Amritsar On 4 and 5 June, messages asking pilgrims to leave the temple were played over loudspeakers. [ 82 ] However, in 2017 the Amritsar District and Sessions Judge Gurbir Singh gave a ruling in which he stated: ""There is no evidence that army made any announcements asking ordinary civilians to leave Golden Temple complex before launching the operation in 1984...There is no written record of any public announcement by the civil authorities requesting the people to come out of the complex. No log of vehicle used for making such announcements is there...The event underlines the human rights violations by troops during the operation."" [ 103 ] [ 104 ] The lack of evidence of any warning to vacate the temple complex was the basis of a compensatory award given to Sikhs who had been illegally detained by the Indian military. [ 103 ] The army began bombarding the historic Ramgarhia Bunga , the water tank, and other fortified positions with Ordnance QF 25-pounder artillery. After destroying the outer defences laid by Shabeg Singh, the army moved tanks and armoured personnel carrier (APCs) onto the road separating the Guru Nanak Niwas building. [ 105 ] The army helicopters spotted the massive movements, and General Krishnaswamy Sundarji sent tanks and APCs to meet them. [ 106 ] The accounts of survivors inside of the temple complex were consistent with the military commencing its assault in the early morning of June 4. [ 101 ] Duggal states that the army attack started at 4:00 am with a 25-pounder that fell in the ramparts of the Deori to the left of the Akal Takht Sahib. [ 101 ] Duggal further states that during the assault he saw a number of dead bodies of children and women in the Parikrama. [ 101 ] The army's assault had prevented Duggal from leaving the room in which he had taken shelter as he believed it would have resulted in his death. [ 101 ] Another eyewitness, Bhan Singh the Secretary of the SGPC, states that the army provided no warning of the start of the attack which prevented pilgrims and those who came as a part of the Dharam Yudh Morcha from exiting. [ 107 ] A female survivor recalled that it was not until the army began using explosives on the temple that they were aware that it had commenced its assault. [ 107 ] She further stated that within the Harmandir Sahib, there were some granthis (priests), ragis (singers), sevadars (service volunteers) and yatris (pilgrims) but no armed militants. [ 107 ] Prithpal Singh, the sevadar on duty at the Akal rest house which housed pilgrims, stated that it was shelled by the military. [ 107 ] As of May 1985 during the recording of Prithpal's account, the Akal Rest house still bore the bullet marks caused by the Indian Army. [ 108 ] 5 June On 5 June the blind head Ragi of the Harmandir Sahib Amrik Singh and Ragi Avtar Singh, were struck by bullets inside of the Harmandir Sahib by the Indian army. [ 109 ] The army's targeting of the Harmandir Sahib with bullets was in contrast to the alleged restraint stated in the army issued White Paper on 10 July 1984. [ 109 ] As of 5 June pilgrims who had reached the temple on 3 June were still present hiding in rooms. [ 110 ] In one room 40–50 persons were huddled together, including a six-month-old child, during the army's assault. [ 110 ] A female survivor of the assault stated that the army asked people to leave their hiding spots and guaranteed safe passage and water; she recalled seeing the dead bodies of pilgrims who answered the announcements lying in the Parikrama the next morning. [ 110 ] In the morning, shelling started on the building inside the Harmandir Sahib complex. [ 111 ] The 9th division launched a frontal attack on the Akal Takht , although it was unable to secure the building. The Golden Temple complex had honeycombed tunnel structures. [ 112 ] 7:00 pm The BSF and CRPF attacked Hotel Temple View and Brahm Boota Akhara, respectively, on the southwest fringes of the complex. By 10:00 pm both the structures were under their control. [ 2 ] : 81–82 The army simultaneously attacked various other gurdwaras. Sources mention either 42 or 74 locations. [ 105 ] 10:00 pm – 7:30 am Late in the evening, the generals decided to launch a simultaneous attack from three sides. Ten Guards, 1 Para Commandos and Special Frontier Force (SFF) would attack from the main entrance of the complex, and 26 Madras and 9 Kumaon battalions from the hostel complex side entrance from the south. The objective of the 10 Guards was to secure the northern wing of the Temple complex and draw attention away from the SFF who were to secure the western wing of the complex and 1 Para Commandos who were to gain a foothold in Akal Takht and in Harmandir Sahab, with the help of divers. 26 Madras was tasked with securing the southern and the eastern complexes, and the 9 Kumaon regiment with SGPC building and Guru Ramdas Serai. Twelve Bihar was charged with providing a cordon and fire support to the other regiments by neutralising enemy positions under their observance. [ 2 ] : 61 An initial attempt by the commandos to gain a foothold at Darshani Deori failed as they came under devastating fire, after which several further attempts were made with varying degrees of success. Eventually, other teams managed to reach Darshani Deori, a building north of the Nishan Sahib, and started to fire at the Akal Takth and a red building towards its left, so that the SFF troops could get closer to the Darshani Deori and fire gas canisters at Akal Takth. The canisters bounced off the building and affected the troops instead. Meanwhile, 26 Madras and 9 Garhwal Rifles (reserve troops) had come under heavy fire from the Langar rooftop, Guru Ramdas Serai and the buildings in the vicinity. Moreover, they took a lot of time in forcing open the heavy Southern Gate, which had to be shot open with tank fire. This delay caused a lot of casualties among the Indian troops fighting inside the complex. Three tanks and an APC had entered the complex. Crawling was impossible as Shabeg Singh had placed light machine guns nine or ten inches above the ground. The attempt caused many casualties among the Indian troops. A third attempt to gain the Pool was made by a squad of 200 commandos. On the southern side, the Madras and Garhwal battalions were not able to make it to the pavement around the pool because they were engaged by positions on the southern side. Despite the mounting casualties, General Sunderji ordered a fourth assault by the commandos. This time, the Madras battalion was reinforced with two more companies of the 7th Garhwal Rifles under the command of General Kuldip Singh Brar. However, the Madras and Garhwal troops under Brigadier A. K. Dewan once again failed to move towards the parikarma (the pavement around the pool). Brigadier Dewan reported heavy casualties and requested more reinforcements. General Brar sent two companies of 15 Kumaon Regiment. This resulted in yet more heavy casualties, forcing Brigadier Dewan to request tank support. As one APC inched closer to the Akal Takth it was hit with an anti-tank RPG , which immediately immobilized it. Brar also requested tank support. The tanks received the clearance to fire their main guns (105 mm high-explosive squash head shells) only at around 7:30 am. [ 2 ] : 81–110 An OT-64 SKOT disabled by RPGs According to Giani Puran Singh, a priest in Harimander Sahib, at 10:00 pm tanks began entering the temple complex. At the same time armored carriers began entering to. [ 9 ] : 75 6 June The army used seven Vijayanta Tanks during the operation. [ 113 ] At 10:00 am the ""vigerous"" battle ended. In the battle about 40–50 Sikh fought the army continuously until they died or ran out of ammunition. Once this battle ended the army gained control of Darshani Deori, Clock Tower, and Atta Mandi. [ 9 ] : 75 Vijayanta tanks shelled the Akal Takht. It suffered some damage, but the structure was still standing. [ 112 ] The Special Group , a confidential special forces unit of the R&AW , began its planned raid on this day. [ 114 ] 7–10 June The army entered the Akal Takht. Dead bodies of Bhindranwale, Shabeg Singh and Amrik Singh were discovered in the building. [ 112 ] Few surviving snipers who had managed to hold off the army for 3 days were killed. [ 9 ] : 90 At noon the army burned down the Sikh Reference Library . The library contained numerous artefacts and contained letters signed by the Sikh gurus. [ 9 ] : 90 According to Giani Puran Singh, a Granthi of the Golden Temple, on June 7 at Ramgharia Bunga 4 Sikh held out at a trench they had dug. Giani Puran Singh was told by soldier to negotiate with them, but they pledged to die there. They killed multiple soldiers. The army failed to fight the Sikh so they attempted bombing them, but the Sikh still held out. They were eventually drawn out with chemical gas and were killed on June 10. [ 115 ] President Zail Singh visited the temple premises after the operation, while making the round, he was shot at by a sniper from one of the buildings that the army had not yet cleared. The bullet hit the arm of an army colonel who led a Commando battalion. He was accompanying the president. On June 8, he was shot by the Sikh held out in Ramgharia Bunga. [ 116 ] : 704 [ 117 ] [ 118 ] The Sikh held out were Major Singh Nagoke, Dalbir Singh, Swaran Singh Rode, Ram Singh Sultanpuri, and Nand Singh Patti. [ 119 ] Casualties The Indian army initially placed total casualties at [ 82 ] 554 Sikh militants and civilians dead, [ 16 ] and 83 killed (4 officers, 79 soldiers) and 236 wounded among government forces. Kuldip Nayar cites Rajiv Gandhi as allegedly admitting that nearly 700 soldiers were killed. [ 19 ] This number was allegedly disclosed by Gandhi in September 1984 as he was addressing the National Student Union of India session in Nagpur . [ 15 ] : 96 Per Ved Marwah the army suffered 35% casualties. [ 120 ] [ 81 ] : 96 According to a close associate of Bhindranwale only 35 militants were killed with the rest leaving in the early days of the Operation. They left because of a plan devised in which they would launch a revolution against the state to form Khalistan so the movement may live on. The belief of the militants was that it is better for some to live to fight another day. According to the associate all who left would die in the Punjab Insurgency. [ 121 ] Independent casualty figures were much higher. [ 24 ] Bhindranwale and large number of his militants were killed. There were high civilian casualties as well, which the Indian government argued were due to Sikhs in the Golden Temple using pilgrims trapped inside the temple as human shields , [ 32 ] though the operation was conducted at a time when the Golden Temple was packed to capacity with pilgrims who were there to celebrate the annual martyrdom anniversary of Guru Arjan Dev, the fifth Guru of the Sikhs. [ 23 ] The pilgrims were not allowed by the militants to escape from the temple premises in spite of relaxation in the curfew hours by the security forces. [ 62 ] According to Indian army generals, ""it is possible"" that militants were ""depending upon the Sikh masses to form a human shield to prevent action by the army"", as well as the presence of a ""whole lot of moderate Akali leadership"". [ 122 ] Delivering the findings of a review in 2014, U.K. Foreign Secretary William Hague attributed high civilian casualties to the Indian Government's attempt at a full frontal assault on the militants, diverging from the recommendations provided by the U.K. Military . [ 123 ] [ 124 ] The Indian military had created a situation where civilians were allowed to collect inside of the temple complex. On 3 June the Indian military allowed pilgrims to enter the temple complex. [ 98 ] The Indian military also allowed thousands of protestors whom were a part of the Dharam Yudh Morcha to enter the temple complex. [ 98 ] These protestors included women and children. [ 98 ] There was no warning provided to the pilgrims who entered on 3 June that a curfew was put in place by the military. [ 98 ] These pilgrims were prevented from leaving after the curfew had been placed by the army at approximately 10:00 pm. [ 98 ] On 4 June no warning was provided to the pilgrims to evacuate and the pilgrims were deterred of leaving as the Indian army would arrest anyone who left the temple complex. [ 94 ] Although officially the army stated that it made announcements, the eyewitness testimony of pilgrims who were arrested after the assault was used as the basis of a decision in the Amritsar district court in April 2017, which held that the army made no such announcements. [ 103 ] The eyewitness testimony of survivors of the army's assault on the temple complex were consistent with stating that they were unaware of the start of the attack by the army until it took place without notice on the morning of 4 June. [ 101 ] On 6 June the Indian military detained surviving pilgrims on the grounds that they were affiliated with the militants and subjected them to interrogations, beatings and executions. [ 125 ] Aftermath The operation also led to the assassination of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi on 31 October 1984 by two of her Sikh bodyguards as an act of vengeance, [ 126 ] [ 127 ] triggering the 1984 Sikh massacre . The widespread killing of Sikhs, principally in the national capital Delhi but also in other major cities in North India, led to major divisions between the Sikh community and the Indian Government . The army withdrew from Harmandir Sahib later in 1984 under pressure from Sikh demands. [ 128 ] The 1985 bombing of Air India Flight 182 is thought to have been a revenge action. General Arun Shridhar Vaidya , the Chief of Army Staff at the time of Operation Blue Star, was assassinated in 1986 in Pune by two Sikhs, Harjinder Singh Jinda and Sukhdev Singh Sukha . Both were sentenced to death, and hanged on 7 October 1992. In March 1986, Sikh militants again occupied and continued to use the temple compound which necessitated another police action known as Operation Black Thunder on 1 May 1986, Indian paramilitary police entered the temple and arrested 200 militants that had occupied Harmandir Sahib for more than three months. [ 129 ] On 2 May 1986 the paramilitary police undertook a 12-hour operation to take control of Harmandir Sahib at Amritsar from several hundred militants, but almost all the major radical leaders managed to escape. [ 130 ] In June 1990, the Indian government ordered the area surrounding the temple to be vacated by local residents in order to prevent militants activity around the temple. [ 131 ] Mutinies by Sikh soldiers In the aftermath of Operation Blue Star, mutinies by Sikh soldiers, mostly raw recruits, were reported from different places. On 7 June, six hundred soldiers of the 9th Battalion of the Sikh Regiment , almost the entire other ranks' strength, mutinied in Sri Ganganagar . While some managed to escape to Pakistan, most were rounded up by men of the Rajputana Rifles . The largest mutiny took place in the Sikh Regimental Centre at Ramgarh , in Bihar , where recruits for the Sikh Regiment are trained. There, 1,461 soldiers—1,050 of them raw recruits, stormed the armoury, killing one officer and injuring two before they set out for Amritsar. The leaders of the mutiny divided the troops into two groups just outside of Banaras to avoid a rumoured roadblock. One half was engaged by army artillery at Shakteshgarh railway station; those who managed to escape were rounded up by the 21st Mechanised Infantry Regiment . The other half engaged with the artillery and troops of the 20th Infantry Brigade , during which 35 soldiers, of both sides, were killed. [ 132 ] [ 133 ] [ 66 ] : 195 There were five smaller mutinies in different parts of India. In total 55 mutineers were killed and 2,606 were captured alive. [ 134 ] [ 133 ] The captured mutineers were court-martialed, despite efforts by various groups including retired Sikh officers to get them reinstated. [ 66 ] : 199 In August 1985, 900 of the 2,606 mutineers were rehabilitated by the Central government as part of the Rajiv–Longowal Accord . [ 133 ] Long term effects Aerial view of the Galliara park around the complex The long-term results of the operation included: Intended to end the insurgency, the operation, had the opposite effect, with attacks escalating. [ 56 ] There was more violence in Punjab after Operation Blue Star than prior. Official estimates of civilians, police, and terrorists killed increased with 27 in 1981, 22 in 1982, and 99 in 1983 to more than one thousand per year from 1987 to 1992. [ 135 ] Outraging Sikhs all over India, with most finding it unacceptable that the armed forces had desecrated the Golden Temple, thousands of young men can join the Khalistan movement , [ 32 ] with ""organized insurgency not taking root in Punjab until after the operation"". [ 136 ] Sikhs became outraged with the military action in the bastion of Sikhi that provoked a wave of deep anguish and long-term resentment. [ 137 ] The operation inflamed tensions in Punjab, though independence would only be declared by a Sarbat Khalsa in 1986, as 500,000 deployed Indian troops operated violently in Punjab, causing thousands of Sikh deaths between 1984 and 1992. [ 138 ] [ 139 ] Following the operation the central government demolished hundreds of houses and created a corridor around the compound called ""Galliara"" (also spelled Galiara or Galyara) for security reasons. [ 140 ] This was made into a public park and opened in June 1988. [ 141 ] [ 142 ] [ 143 ] [ 144 ] Criticisms The operation has been criticized on several grounds including: the government's choice of timing for the attack, the heavy casualties, the loss of property, and human rights violations . Timing Operation Blue Star was planned on a Sikh religious day—the martyrdom day of Guru Arjan Dev , the founder of the Harmandir Sahib . Sikhs from all over the world visit the temple on this day. Many Sikhs view the timing and attack by the army as an attempt to inflict maximum casualties on Sikhs and demoralize them, [ 145 ] and the government is in turn blamed for the inflated number of civilian casualties by choosing to attack on that day. Additionally, Longowal had announced a statewide civil disobedience movement that would launch on 3 June 1984. Participants planned to block the flow of grain out of Punjab and refuse to pay land revenue, water and electricity bills. [ 25 ] : 341 [ 2 ] : 31 When asked about why the army entered the temple premises just after Guru Arjan Dev's martyrdom day (when the number of devotees is much higher), General Brar said that it was just a coincidence and that while he could not ""comment on the inside of politics"", he ""assume[d] that after taking everything into consideration, the Prime Minister and the government decided this was the only course of action left"", with ""perhaps"" the army having only had three to four days to complete the operation. Based on ""some sort of information"", Bhindranwale was planning to declare Khalistan an independent country any moment with ""a strong possibility"" of support from Pakistan, and ""Khalistani currency had already been distributed"". This declaration ""might"" have increased chances of ""large sections"" of Punjab Police and security personnel siding with Bhindranwale; as ""if there could be desertions in the army, then the police, who were in Punjab, who were privy to Bhindranwale's speeches, might have [also deserted]"", as ""they were also emotionally charged by what was happening"". [ 146 ] The army waited for the surrender of militants on the night of 5 June, but the surrender did not happen. The operation had to be completed before dawn. Otherwise, exaggerated messages of army besieging the temple would have attracted mobs from nearby villages to the temple premises. The army could not have fired upon these civilians. More importantly, Pakistan would have come in the picture, declaring its support for Khalistan. [ 147 ] He described the operation as traumatic and painful, but necessary. [ 148 ] Media censorship Before the attack by the army, a media blackout was imposed in Punjab. [ 149 ] The Times reporter Michael Hamlyn reported that journalists were picked up from their hotels at 5 am in a military bus, taken to the adjoining border of the state of Haryana and ""were abandoned there"". [ 149 ] The main towns in Punjab were put under curfew, transportation was banned, a news blackout was imposed, and Punjab was ""cut off from the outside world"". [ 150 ] A group of journalists who later tried to drive into Punjab were stopped at the road block at Punjab border and were threatened with being shot if they proceeded. [ 149 ] Indian nationals who worked with the foreign media also were banned from the area. [ 149 ] The press criticized these actions by government as an ""obvious attempt to attack the temple without the eyes of the foreign press on them"". [ 151 ] The media blackout throughout Punjab resulted in spread of rumours. The only available source of information during the period was All India Radio and the Doordarshan channel. [ 152 ] Human rights Sikh militants The government issued White Paper alleged that on June 6, a group of some 350 people, including Longowal and Tohra surrendered to the army near the Guru Nanak Niwas. [ 153 ] The White Paper further alleged that to prevent the surrender, the militants opened fire and threw grenades at the group resulting in the deaths of 70 people, including 30 women and 5 children. [ 153 ] However, neither Bhan Singh nor Longowal during their recounting of the events that took place on June 6 made any reference to either surrendering to the military or an attack on civilians by the militants. [ 153 ] The government issued White Paper alleged that on 8 June 1984, an unarmed army doctor was abducted by the militants and was hacked to death. [ 153 ] However, Giani Puran Singh who was called by the military to act as a mediator to facilitate the surrender of four militants in the basement of the Bunga Jassa Singh Ramgharia, stated that the ""so called doctor"" had been killed along with two other army personnel when they ventured close to the militant's hiding place. [ 153 ] Indian Army Former Indian Service Officer Ramesh Inder Singh, [ 154 ] the then Deputy Commissioner (DC) of Amritsar in one of his interview with BBC said that even the Governor of (Indian) Punjab did not know that there would be military action and he indicated that the Operation was badly carried out and panic among foot soldiers was so evident that they were formalizing their plans on the bonnets of their vehicles. Brahma Chellaney , the Associated Press 's South Asia correspondent, was the only foreign reporter who managed to stay on in Amritsar despite the media blackout. [ 155 ] His dispatches, filed by telex , provided the first non-governmental news reports on the bloody operation in Amritsar. His first dispatch, front-paged by The New York Times , The Times of London and The Guardian , reported a death toll about twice of what authorities had admitted. According to the dispatch, about 780 militants and civilians and 400 troops had perished in fierce gun-battles. [ 156 ] Chellaney reported that about ""eight to ten"" men suspected Sikh militants had been shot with their hands tied. In that dispatch, Mr. Chellaney interviewed a doctor who said he had been picked up by the army and forced to conduct postmortems despite the fact he had never done any postmortem examination before. [ 157 ] In reaction to the dispatch, the Indian government charged Chellaney with violating Punjab press censorship, two counts of fanning sectarian hatred and trouble, and later with sedition, [ 158 ] calling his report baseless and disputing his casualty figures. [ 159 ] The Supreme Court of India ordered Chellaney to cooperate with Amritsar police, who interrogated him concerning his report and sources. Chellaney declined to reveal his source, citing journalistic ethics and the constitutional guarantee of freedom of the press. In September 1985 charges against Chellaney were dropped. [ 158 ] The Associated Press stood by the accuracy of the reports and figures, which were ""supported by Indian and other press accounts"". [ 160 ] Similar accusations of highhandedness by the army and allegations of human rights violations by security forces in Operation Blue Star and subsequent military operations in Punjab have been leveled by Justice V. M. Tarkunde , [ 161 ] Mary Anne Weaver, [ 162 ] human rights lawyer Ram Narayan Kumar, [ 163 ] and anthropologists Cynthia Mahmood and Joyce Pettigrew. [ 15 ] [ 164 ] [ 165 ] Some of the human rights abuses alleged to have been committed by the Indian army were: In April 2017 Justice Gurbir Singh stated that the army's failure to provide any announcement to pilgrims before commencing Operation Blue Star was a human rights violation. [ 103 ] The Indian army mistreated pilgrims who were detained immediately after the fighting stopped on June 6 by failing to provide them any water. Some pilgrims were reduced to collecting drinking water from the canals that contained dead bodies and were filled with blood. [ 166 ] Ragi Harcharan Singh stated that on June 6 the Indian army gave its first announcement for evacuation since the commencement of Operation Blue Star. Singh states that he witnessed hundreds of pilgrims, including women, being shot at by the army as they emerged from hiding. [ 36 ] A female survivor witnessed Indian soldiers line up Sikh men in a queue, tie their arms behind their backs with their turbans, beat them with rifle butts until they bled and then executed by being shot. [ 167 ] Giana Puran Singh stated he along with 3–4 others were used as human shields for the protection of an officer who wanted to inspect the inside of the Darbar Sahib for anyone using a machine gun. [ 168 ] A member of the AISSF stated that on June 6 those who surrendered before the army were made to lie down on the hot road, interrogated, made to move on their knees, bit with rifle butts and kicked with boots on private parts and their heads. The detainees were made to have their arms tied behind their backs with their own turbans and denied water. At about 7:00 pm the detainees were made to sit on the Parikrama near the army tanks. Many were injured as there was still firing from the side of the Akal Takht. [ 168 ] Post-mortem reports showed that most of the dead bodies had their hands tied behind their backs, implying they had died after the army assault and not during. These bodies were in a putrid state at the time of post-mortem as they had been exposed in the open for 72 hours before being brought in. [ 37 ] The Red Cross was stopped from aiding the wounded civilians by the army. [ 9 ] : 85 Punjab officials who visited after the Operation complained to the army of 6 cases of rape during the Operation by soldiers that they had heard of. [ 9 ] : 78 The Indian Army responded to this criticism by stating that they ""answered the call of duty as disciplined, loyal and dedicated members of the Armed Forces of India. ... our loyalties are to the nation, the armed forces to which we belong, the uniforms we wear and to the troops we command."" [ 2 ] Strategy Blue Star encompassed 41 other gurdwaras all over Punjab, in which more than 3 army divisions were deployed. [ 122 ] As later events conclusively proved, the operations was not only flawed in its very concept, but marred by poor planning and execution. [ 23 ] According to Khushwant Singh , ""As far as the competence of the Army the less said the better. In an age where a handful of Israeli or German commandos could, through a well-planned action overcome a well-entrenched enemy thousands of miles away from them, the best our generals could do was to storm the Temple complex with tanks and armoured cars, blast the Akal Takht to get at Bhindranwale and 200 of his men. In crossfire upwards of 5,000 people, a majority of them pilgrims, including women and children, lost their lives.... Far from doing a competent job, our army commanders botched up a simple operation."" [ 23 ] As reported by Indian Army Major General Afsir Karim , among the main factors of planning and conduct which aggravated the impact of this operation, the foremost decision was to launch the assault on the day of the martyrdom day of Guru Arjan , the builder of the temple, described as ""sheer perversity"", as a large number of pilgrims were bound to be injured and killed. [ 23 ] The date being chosen for its surprise factor, or the presence of pilgrims potentially preventing the militants from responding, showed ""cynical disregard"" for innocent lives, with ""neither good soldiering nor honourable combat"" on the part of the senior generals in charge of planning the operation. [ 23 ] They would later ""make various statements, invent excuses, and shade the truth to hide inconvenient facts"". [ 23 ] The incompetence resulting in the burning of the Sikh Reference Library was taken as ""vengeful vandalism"" by the Sikh masses. [ 23 ] The additional Army action of Operation Woodrose , where 37 other gurdwaras were subjected to a combing operation, also put the Sikhs on notice and created an atmosphere of terror, widening the scope of the conflict. [ 136 ] There was ""little doubt"", according to Karim, that it was the operation, because of its lasting adverse effects on the Sikh masses, which put a majority of unemployed Sikh youth, disadvantaged by the economic results of the Green Revolution that the Dharam Yudh Morcha had been launched to ameliorate through the implementation of the Anandpur Sahib Resolution , on the road to insurgency. [ 136 ] After the operation a large number crossed the border for training and weaponry, as an operation where ""thousands of Sikh youth were humiliated, harassed, and physically hurt was bound to intensify the conflict"". [ 136 ] Previously the conflict had been limited to a few radical groups and scattered, small-scale incidents; after, it affected all of Punjab, with ""organized insurgency not taking root in Punjab until after the operation"". [ 136 ] The military operation was a disastrous political decision and severely bungled; [ 169 ] Lt. Gen. S. K. Sinha would later characterize the operation as both a political and military blunder, [ 170 ] and would cite Sundarji as flouting standard operating procedure laid out by Sinha, [ 170 ] seeking army promotion, [ 170 ] and impressing Indira Gandhi, [ 170 ] who wanted to appear politically strong to her electorate after frustrations in Kashmir. He would also ascribe his dismissal by Gandhi to his attempts to put up his views of the Akali problem, [ 170 ] and his long personal friendships with Akalis, [ 170 ] which he believed irritated Gandhi. [ 170 ] According to retired Lt. Gen. Shankar Prasad, ""It was because of the disasters called Vaidya [who superseded Sinha] and Sundarji—who did not have the brains to pick on the plans left behind by Lt Gen S.K. Sinha—that we had both a political folly compounded by a military botch-up."" [ 171 ] He would blame Sundarji more for the operation than Vaidya, who he says ""was taken in by Sundarji's swagger"", [ 171 ] and that both ""were being politically subservient to the Prime Minister... maybe they wanted governorships or ambassadorships after serving their time"". [ 171 ] Prasad also believed that the military high command should have refused to implement the order, and craft a more suitable operation in its place, instead of being pressured by deadlines from the political leadership. [ 171 ] In the UK cabinet secretary's report, contrary to the advice of a British military advisor in February 1984 of surgical strike involving a helicopter-borne commando operation had advised in February 1984, the Indian Army went into the temple ""sledgehammer-style"", [ 171 ] with massive casualties of civilians. [ 171 ] The assault on the Golden Temple would be later recognized as a major blunder on the part of the central government even by Congress leaders. [ 172 ] Five years later, the army's strategy was criticised by comparing it with the blockade approach taken by KPS Gill in Operation Black Thunder , when Sikh militants had again taken over the temple complex. It was said that Operation Blue Star could have been averted by using similar blockade tactics. The army responded by stating that ""no comparison is possible between the two situations"", as ""there was no cult figure like Bhindranwale to idolise, and no professional military general like Shahbeg Singh to provide military leadership"" and ""the confidence of militants having been shattered by Operation Blue Star"". [ 2 ] Furthermore, it was pointed out that the separatists in the temple were armed with machine guns , anti-tank missiles and Chinese-made armour-piercing rocket launchers , and that they strongly resisted the army's attempts to dislodge them from the shrine, appearing to have planned for a long standoff, having arranged for water to be supplied from wells within the temple compound and had stocked food provisions that could have lasted months. [ 2 ] : 153–154 Honours to the soldiers The soldiers and generals involved in the Operation were presented with gallantry awards, honours, decoration strips and promotions by the Indian president Zail Singh , a Sikh, in a ceremony conducted on 10 July 1985. The act was criticized by authors and activists such as Harjinder Singh Dilgeer , who accused the troops of human rights violations during the operation. [ 173 ] British involvement The accidental release of secret documents in the United Kingdom in 2014 revealed that the Thatcher government was aware of the Indian government's intention to storm the temple and that a Special Air Service officer was tasked to advise the Indian authorities on removing the armed Sikh militants from the Golden Temple. According to a report by the Sikh Federation of UK, India was one of the biggest purchasers of military equipment for UK between 1981 and 1990. Most of the Foreign Office's documents on India from 1984 are classified in whole or in part. [ 73 ] See also Kharku Khalistan movement Golden Temple References ^ Jerryson, Michael (15 July 2020).

The 1988 Maldives coup d'état attempt was by a group of Sri Lankans and Maldivians led by businessman Abdullah Luthufee and assisted by armed mercenaries of a Tamil secessionist organization from Sri Lanka , the People's Liberation Organization of Tamil Eelam (PLOTE), to overthrow the government in the island republic of Maldives . The attempt was thwarted with Indian assistance in Operation Cactus. Coup attempt [ edit ] Whereas the 1980 and 1983 coup d'état attempts against Maumoon Abdul Gayoom 's presidency were not considered serious, the third coup d'état attempt in November 1988 alarmed the international community. [ 1 ] About 80 armed PLOTE mercenaries landed in the capital Malé before dawn aboard speedboats from a hijacked Sri Lankan freighter. [ 2 ] Disguised as visitors, a similar number had already infiltrated Malé earlier. The mercenaries quickly gained control of the capital, including the major government buildings, airport, port, television and radio stations. [ 2 ] The mercenaries then marched towards the Presidential Palace where President Gayoom was residing with his family. [ 2 ] But before they reached the Presidential Palace, President Gayoom was escorted by Maldivian National Security Advisor to the Defense Minister's home. The Defense Minister then escorted the President to a safe house. Meanwhile, the mercenaries had seized the Presidential Palace and managed to take the Maldivian Education Minister as hostage. President Gayoom requested military intervention from Sri Lanka and Pakistan , but both denied any help, citing a lack of military capabilities. [ 2 ] The president then requested Singapore 's intervention, but Singapore declined, citing the same reasons. [ 2 ] After that, he contacted the United States , but was told that it would take US forces 2–3 days to reach the Maldives from their nearest military base in Diego Garcia , 1000 km away. [ 3 ] The president then contacted the United Kingdom , which advised them to seek assistance from India . [ 2 ] Following this, President Gayoom contacted the Indian government for assistance. India swiftly accepted their request and an emergency meeting was arranged at the Secretariat Building in New Delhi. Within 16 hours of the SOS , India was ready to commence their operation. Operation Cactus [ edit ] Rejaul Karim Laskar , a member of the then-ruling political party in India- Indian National Congress , stated that India's intervention in the attempted coup became necessary as in the absence of Indian intervention, external powers would have been tempted to intervene or even to establish bases in Maldives, which being in India 's backyard would have been detrimental to India's national interest . [ 4 ] India, therefore, intervened with ""Operation Cactus"". The operation started on the night of 3 November 1988, when Ilyushin Il-76 aircraft of the Indian Air Force airlifted the elements of the 50th Independent Parachute Brigade , commanded by Brigadier Farukh Bulsara , the 6th Battalion of the Parachute Regiment and the 17th Parachute Field Regiment from Agra Air Force Station and flew them non-stop over 2,000 kilometers (1,240 mi) to land them over the Malé International Airport on Hulhule Island . The Indian Army paratroopers arrived on Hulhule in nine hours after the appeal from President Gayoom. [ 5 ] [ 6 ] The Indian paratroopers immediately secured the airfield , crossed over to Malé using commandeered boats and rescued President Gayoom. The paratroopers restored control of the capital to President Gayoom's government within hours. Some of the mercenaries fled toward Sri Lanka in a hijacked freighter. Those unable to reach the ship in time were quickly rounded up and handed over to the Maldives government. Nineteen people reportedly died in the fighting, most of them mercenaries. The dead included two hostages killed by the mercenaries. The Indian Navy frigates Godavari and Betwa intercepted the freighter off the Sri Lankan coast, and captured the mercenaries. The swift intervention by the Indian military and accurate intelligence successfully quelled the attempted coup d'état in the island nation. [ 7 ] Reaction [ edit ] India received international praise for the operation. United States President Ronald Reagan expressed his appreciation for India's action, calling it ""a valuable contribution to regional stability"". British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher reportedly commented, ""Thank God for India: President Gayoom's government has been saved"". But the intervention nevertheless caused some disquiet among India's neighbors in South Asia. [ 8 ] Aftermath [ edit ] In July 1989, India repatriated the mercenaries captured on board the hijacked freighter to Maldives to stand trial. President Gayoom commuted the death sentences passed against them to life imprisonment under Indian pressure. [ 9 ] The 1988 coup d'état had been headed by a once prominent Maldivian businessperson named Abdullah Luthufi, who was operating a farm in Sri Lanka . Former Maldivian President Ibrahim Nasir was accused, but denied any involvement in the coup d'état. In fact, in July 1990, President Gayoom officially pardoned Nasir in absentia in recognition of his role in obtaining Maldives ' independence. [ 7 ] The operation also strengthened Indo-Maldivian relations as a result of the successful restoration of the Gayoom government.

[ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ] The operation was initiated by the 57th Mountain Division of the Indian Army , which tracked down and decapitated a rebel column that had picked up a huge consignment of weapons at the Wyakaung beach, on the Myanmar-Bangladesh coast south of Chittagong and Cox's Bazar , Bangladesh , [ 5 ] and was moving that through the jungles of Mizoram , Northeast India . [ 6 ] The consignment was to be delivered in Manipur , India . [ 7 ] The operation was named after a Grimm Brothers fairytale . [ 8 ] Operation Golden Bird was a joint India-Myanmar military operation carried out along the Mizoram border that led to the killing of dozens of militants. [ 9 ] [ 10 ] It was considered to be a successful counter-insurgency operation by the Indian Army. [ 11 ] [ better source needed ] Background [ edit ] This section does not cite any sources . Please help improve this section by adding citations to reliable sources . Unsourced material may be challenged and removed . ( June 2022 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) Location of Cox's Bazar in Bangladesh The weapons were purchased in Thailand and were brought by sea to Bangladesh, before being smuggled back to Northeast India by groups of rebel guerrillas. Wyakaung beach, located south of Bangladesh's coastal town of Cox's Bazar , was the most common landing spot for these weapons, but at least six other points in the Cox's Bazar district were also used. The guerrillas of the National Socialist Council of Nagaland, the Manipuri groups, the United Liberation Front of Assam and the National Democratic Front of Boroland would then collect the weapons and carry them back via one of three routes: the Chittagong Hill Tracts-south Mizoram-east Manipur route, skirting the border with Burma; the Chittagong Hill Tracts-tripura-west Mizoram-west Manipur route; or the Chittagong-Sylhet-Meghalaya-Assam route. In the preceding several years, Sylhet-Meghalaya had been used more frequently by the rebels. The Directorate General of Forces Intelligence helped the Northeast Indian rebel groups to safely land these weapons, [ citation needed ] and only on a few occasions were weapons meant for the rebel groups intercepted by the Bangladesh police, who believed that the weapons were intended for criminals in that country. With Bangladesh emerging as the gateway to Northeast India for weapons imported from Thailand, the rebels in Tripura [ 12 ] were best located to carry them back. Both the National Liberation Front of Tripura and the All-Tripura Tiger Force secured weapons from the National Socialist Council of Nagaland . The National Democratic Front of Boroland and the United Liberation Front of Assam helped them cache the weapons at their bases in the Chittagong Hill tracts before they were carried to their respective base areas in Northeast India. [ citation needed ] The operation [ edit ] Location of Chittagong Hill Tracts in Bangladesh Operation Golden Bird was initiated to intercept a column of north-eastern rebels —Naga, Manipuri and Assamese — travelling through the jungles of southern Mizoram after picking up a consignment of weapons that had landed at Wyakaung beach, on the Myanmar-Bangladesh coast. [ 13 ] The operation was aimed at exposing the United Liberation Front of Assam, the National Socialist Council of Nagaland and Manipuri fighters in camps along the border. The Bangladesh military intelligence service, the Directorate General of Forces Intelligence , had helped carry the consignment in trucks to a hill base in the Chittagong Hill Tracts , from where the rebels had picked them up. The National Unity Party of Arakan guerrillas followed the whole operation, providing details to Indian military intelligence, on the basis of which India’s eastern army command initiated Operation Golden Bird. The rebel column was twice intercepted by Indian troops. It was a 45-day operation, but the operation ended abruptly as Rangoon ordered its army to pull out in the middle of the operation. [ 14 ] [ 15 ] The Myanmar army played its part by sealing its side of the border, until they were upset by the awarding of the Jawaharlal Nehru Award to Aung San Suu Kyi , and the survivors of the trapped rebel column were able to escape into the Myanmar's Chin Hills through gaps in the dragnet caused by the Myanmar Armed Forces' withdrawal. [ 16 ] Casualties [ edit ] 38 rebels were killed, 118 captured and more than 100 weapons were seized with large quantities of ammunition. [ 17 ] [ 18 ] [ 19 ] The captured rebels confessed to the weapons trail and India pressured Bangladesh during Khaleda Zia 's first government (1991-1996) to close it. The Myanmar Army took some casualties in this operation. See also [ edit ] Indo-Burma barrier Chittagong Hill Tracts Insurgency in Northeast India References [ edit ] ^ ""ARMS AND THE MEN"" .

The 1988 Maldives coup d'état attempt was by a group of Sri Lankans and Maldivians led by businessman Abdullah Luthufee and assisted by armed mercenaries of a Tamil secessionist organization from Sri Lanka , the People's Liberation Organization of Tamil Eelam (PLOTE), to overthrow the government in the island republic of Maldives . The attempt was thwarted with Indian assistance in Operation Cactus. Coup attempt [ edit ] Whereas the 1980 and 1983 coup d'état attempts against Maumoon Abdul Gayoom 's presidency were not considered serious, the third coup d'état attempt in November 1988 alarmed the international community. [ 1 ] About 80 armed PLOTE mercenaries landed in the capital Malé before dawn aboard speedboats from a hijacked Sri Lankan freighter. [ 2 ] Disguised as visitors, a similar number had already infiltrated Malé earlier. The mercenaries quickly gained control of the capital, including the major government buildings, airport, port, television and radio stations. [ 2 ] The mercenaries then marched towards the Presidential Palace where President Gayoom was residing with his family. [ 2 ] But before they reached the Presidential Palace, President Gayoom was escorted by Maldivian National Security Advisor to the Defense Minister's home. The Defense Minister then escorted the President to a safe house. Meanwhile, the mercenaries had seized the Presidential Palace and managed to take the Maldivian Education Minister as hostage. President Gayoom requested military intervention from Sri Lanka and Pakistan , but both denied any help, citing a lack of military capabilities. [ 2 ] The president then requested Singapore 's intervention, but Singapore declined, citing the same reasons. [ 2 ] After that, he contacted the United States , but was told that it would take US forces 2–3 days to reach the Maldives from their nearest military base in Diego Garcia , 1000 km away. [ 3 ] The president then contacted the United Kingdom , which advised them to seek assistance from India . [ 2 ] Following this, President Gayoom contacted the Indian government for assistance. India swiftly accepted their request and an emergency meeting was arranged at the Secretariat Building in New Delhi. Within 16 hours of the SOS , India was ready to commence their operation. Operation Cactus [ edit ] Rejaul Karim Laskar , a member of the then-ruling political party in India- Indian National Congress , stated that India's intervention in the attempted coup became necessary as in the absence of Indian intervention, external powers would have been tempted to intervene or even to establish bases in Maldives, which being in India 's backyard would have been detrimental to India's national interest . [ 4 ] India, therefore, intervened with ""Operation Cactus"". The operation started on the night of 3 November 1988, when Ilyushin Il-76 aircraft of the Indian Air Force airlifted the elements of the 50th Independent Parachute Brigade , commanded by Brigadier Farukh Bulsara , the 6th Battalion of the Parachute Regiment and the 17th Parachute Field Regiment from Agra Air Force Station and flew them non-stop over 2,000 kilometers (1,240 mi) to land them over the Malé International Airport on Hulhule Island . The Indian Army paratroopers arrived on Hulhule in nine hours after the appeal from President Gayoom. [ 5 ] [ 6 ] The Indian paratroopers immediately secured the airfield , crossed over to Malé using commandeered boats and rescued President Gayoom. The paratroopers restored control of the capital to President Gayoom's government within hours. Some of the mercenaries fled toward Sri Lanka in a hijacked freighter. Those unable to reach the ship in time were quickly rounded up and handed over to the Maldives government. Nineteen people reportedly died in the fighting, most of them mercenaries. The dead included two hostages killed by the mercenaries. The Indian Navy frigates Godavari and Betwa intercepted the freighter off the Sri Lankan coast, and captured the mercenaries. The swift intervention by the Indian military and accurate intelligence successfully quelled the attempted coup d'état in the island nation. [ 7 ] Reaction [ edit ] India received international praise for the operation. United States President Ronald Reagan expressed his appreciation for India's action, calling it ""a valuable contribution to regional stability"". British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher reportedly commented, ""Thank God for India: President Gayoom's government has been saved"". But the intervention nevertheless caused some disquiet among India's neighbors in South Asia. [ 8 ] Aftermath [ edit ] In July 1989, India repatriated the mercenaries captured on board the hijacked freighter to Maldives to stand trial. President Gayoom commuted the death sentences passed against them to life imprisonment under Indian pressure. [ 9 ] The 1988 coup d'état had been headed by a once prominent Maldivian businessperson named Abdullah Luthufi, who was operating a farm in Sri Lanka . Former Maldivian President Ibrahim Nasir was accused, but denied any involvement in the coup d'état. In fact, in July 1990, President Gayoom officially pardoned Nasir in absentia in recognition of his role in obtaining Maldives ' independence. [ 7 ] The operation also strengthened Indo-Maldivian relations as a result of the successful restoration of the Gayoom government.

[ 1 ] The operation is believed to have begun in November 2009 along five states in the "" Red Corridor ."" [ citation needed ] The term was coined by the Chhattisgarh police officials to describe one successful drive against the Communist Party of India (Maoist) in the state. It was erroneously used by the media to describe the wider anti-Naxalite operations; the government of India does not use the term ""Operation Green Hunt"" to describe its anti-Naxalite offensive. [ 13 ] Planning and implementation [ edit ] A fleet of Mi-17 V5 has been deployed against the Maoists by the Indian Air Force. In October 2009, the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) announced that it was in the final stages of planning the offensive and had received approval from the Union -led government. The Commando Battalion for Resolute Action (CoBRA) would take the lead in the operations against Maoist insurgents. [ 14 ] But in September 2009, the media had already reported a ""massive three day joint operation"" by the CoBRA and Chhattisgarh police against the Maoists in Dantewada . [ 1 ] In November 2009, the first phase of the operation began in Gadchiroli district . As many as 18 companies of the central paramilitary forces were moved into the area in anticipation of the operation. [ 15 ] In April 2010, Mark Sofer had a conversation with Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and M. K. Narayanan on the subject of the ""Maoist extremism"" and West Bengal 's internal security, and offered assistance by Israel in the state's battle against the Maoists. [ 16 ] In 2009, the government of India had decided to move 80,000 central paramilitary personnel to wage offensive against the Maoists, strengthened by a fleet of 10 armed helicopters from the Indian Air Force . [ 17 ] On 3 January 2013, the government of India said it would deploy 10,000 more central paramilitary personnel in Bastar , Odisha and some parts of Jharkhand. [ 3 ] By May 2013, about 84,000 troops from the CRPF had been stationed in the Red corridor. [ 18 ] Apart from the paramilitary personnel, the SAPF personnel deployed in operations against the Maoists are estimated to number around 200,000. [ 6 ] In his analysis in March 2014, Gautam Navlakha has claimed that 286,200 CRPF personnel along with 100,000 personnel from other central paramilitary forces and the SAPF are now engaged in the offensive against the CPI (Maoist) in 10 states of India. [ 19 ] On 8 June 2014, the Minister of Home Affairs officially approved the deployment of another 10,000 troops from the paramilitary forces to fight against the Maoists in Chhattisgarh. [ 4 ] In May 2013, the Ministry of Home Affairs ordered an additional 10,000 aramilitary personal to move ""towards a fight to finish war against Maoists in Red Zone."" [ 20 ] The Indian Army has also been stationed in the Red corridor; however, the Army claims that it is present there to train the paramilitary personnel to fight against the Maoists and denies its direct role in the offensive operations. [ 21 ] The Chief of the Army Staff and the 7 army commanders in mid-2011 had assessed that, if required, about 60,000-65,000 troops from the Indian Army would need to be induced in Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh , Maharashtra, Odisha and West Bengal to battle the Naxalites. [ 22 ] On 30 May 2013, the Indian Air Force's Air Chief Marshal declared that apart from the currently operating MI-17 helicopters, the Indian Air Force is inducing a fleet of MI-17V5 helicopters to ""provide full support to anti-Naxal operations."" [ 8 ] In August 2014, the Ministry of Home Affairs stated that it is ""sending"" 2,000 personnel from the Naga Battalions of the Nagaland 's Indian Reserve Battalions (IRB) in Chhattisgarh's Bastar to attack the Maoists, which according to The Economic Times , would make Bastar ""the most–militarised zone in India."" The Naga Battalion personnel are being send to fight the Maoists for a second time, with having battled the Maoists once before in West Bengal. [ 5 ] The Indian armed forces' personnel use satellite phones and they also have access to unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). [ 6 ] Security forces have been using UAVs in anti-Maoist operations for quite some time in Bihar , Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand . [ 23 ] Presently, the UAVs are being provided by the National Technical Research Organisation (NTRO) and Indian Air Force, but they have not been able to yield desired results for the armed forces. Hence, to further advance the offensive, the Defence Research and Development Organisation has taken an initiative to specially develop UAVs with ""lower frequency radars"" for the armed forces to ""track down"" the Maoists. [ 24 ] The NTRO has specially imported 12 drones from Israel for aerial surveillance of Naxalites' activities in the forest region on Andhra Pradesh–Orissa–Chhattisgarh border.

In India, this action is referred to as the "" Liberation of Goa "". In Portugal , it is referred to as the "" Invasion of Goa "". Jawaharlal Nehru had hoped that the popular movement in Goa and the pressure of world public opinion would force the Portuguese Goan authorities to grant it independence, but without success; consequently, Krishna Menon suggested taking Goa by force. [ 6 ] [ 7 ] The operation was code named Operation Vijay (meaning ""Victory"" in Sanskrit) by the Indian Armed Forces. It involved air, sea and land strikes for over 36 hours, and was a decisive victory for India, ending 451 years of rule by Portugal over its remaining exclaves in India . The engagement lasted two days, and twenty-two Indians and thirty Portuguese were killed in the fighting. [ 2 ] The brief conflict drew a mixture of worldwide praise and condemnation. In India, the action was seen as a liberation of historically Indian territory, while Portugal viewed it as an aggression against its national soil and citizens. Justifying the successful military action, Nehru remarked that the ""Portuguese ultimately left no choice open to us."" [ 8 ] [ 9 ] Following the end of Portuguese rule in 1961, Goa was placed under military administration headed by Major General Kunhiraman Palat Candeth as lieutenant governor . [ 10 ] On 8 June 1962, military rule was replaced by civilian government when the Lieutenant Governor nominated an informal Consultative Council of 29 nominated members to assist him in the administration of the territory. [ 11 ] Background [ edit ] After India's independence from the British Empire in August 1947, Portugal continued to hold a handful of exclaves on the Indian subcontinent—the districts of Goa , Daman and Diu and Dadra and Nagar Haveli —collectively known as the State of India . Goa, Daman and Diu covered an area of around 1,540 square miles (4,000 km 2 ) and held a population of 637,591. [ 12 ] The Goan diaspora was estimated at 175,000 (about 100,000 within the Indian Union, mainly in Bombay). [ 13 ] Religious distribution was 61% Hindu, 37% Christian (mostly Catholic) and 2% Muslim. [ 13 ] The economy was primarily based on agriculture, although the 1940s and 1950s saw a boom in mining—principally iron ore and some manganese . [ 13 ] Portuguese government [ edit ] Main article: Estado Novo (Portugal) During this period, Portugal was governed by the Estado Novo regime. This government was a dictatorship and a strong proponent of colonialism . The Estado Novo viewed Portugal's overseas territories as extensions of Portugal itself. Under the Estado Novo , Portugal tried to perpetuate a vast, centuries-old empire with a total area of 2,168,071 square kilometres (837,097 sq mi), while other former colonial powers had, by this time, largely acceded to global calls for self-determination and independence of their overseas colonies. [ 14 ] Local resistance to Portuguese rule [ edit ] Main articles: Goa liberation movement and Goa Revolution Day Resistance to Portuguese rule in Goa in the 20th century was pioneered by Tristão de Bragança Cunha , a French-educated Goan engineer who founded the Goa Congress Committee in Portuguese India in 1928. Cunha released a booklet called 'Four hundred years of Foreign Rule', and a pamphlet, 'Denationalisation of Goa', intended to sensitise Goans to the oppression of Portuguese rule. Messages of solidarity were received by the Goa Congress Committee from leading figures in the Indian independence movement including Rajendra Prasad , Jawaharlal Nehru and Subhas Chandra Bose . On 12 October 1938, Cunha with other members of the Goa Congress Committee met Subhas Chandra Bose, the President of the Indian National Congress , and on his advice, opened a Branch Office of the Goa Congress Committee at 21, Dalal Street, Bombay . The Goa Congress was also made affiliate to the Indian National Congress and Cunha was selected as its first President. [ 15 ] In June 1946, Ram Manohar Lohia , an Indian Socialist leader, entered Goa on a visit to his friend, Juliao Menezes , a nationalist leader, who had founded the Gomantak Praja Mandal in Bombay and edited the weekly newspaper Gomantak . Cunha and other leaders were also with him. [ 15 ] Ram Manohar Lohia advocated the use of non-violent Gandhian techniques to oppose the government. [ 16 ] On 18 June 1946, now celebrated as Goa Revolution Day , the Portuguese government disrupted a protest against the suspension of civil liberties in Panaji (then spelt 'Panjim') organised by Lohia, Cunha and others including Purushottam Kakodkar and Laxmikant Bhembre in defiance of a ban on public gatherings, and arrested them. [ 17 ] [ 18 ] There were intermittent mass demonstrations from June to November. In addition to non-violent protests, armed groups such as the Azad Gomantak Dal (Free Goa Party) and the United Front of Goans (UFG) conducted violent attacks aimed at weakening Portuguese rule in Goa. [ 19 ] The Indian government supported the establishment of armed groups like the Azad Gomantak Dal, giving them full financial, logistic and armament support. The armed groups acted from bases situated in Indian territory and under cover of Indian police forces. The Indian government—through these armed groups—attempted to destroy economic targets, telegraph and telephone lines, road, water and rail transport, in order to impede economic activity and create conditions for a general uprising of the population. [ 20 ] A Portuguese army officer stationed with the army in Goa, Captain Carlos Azaredo, stated in 2001 in the Portuguese newspaper Expresso : ""To the contrary to what is being said, the most evolved guerrilla warfare which our Armed Forces encountered was in Goa. I know what I'm talking about, because I also fought in Angola and in Guinea ( Portuguese Guinea ). In 1961 alone, until December, around 80 policemen died. The major part of the freedom fighters of Azad Gomantak Dal (AGD) were not Goans. Many had fought in the British Army , under General Montgomery , against the Germans ."" [ 21 ] Diplomatic efforts to resolve Goa dispute [ edit ] Main article: India–Portugal relations Goa, Western India On 27 February 1950, the government of India asked the Portuguese government to open negotiations about the future of Portuguese colonies in India. [ 22 ] Portugal asserted that its territory on the Indian subcontinent was not a colony but part of metropolitan Portugal and hence its transfer was non-negotiable, and that India had no rights to this territory because the Republic of India did not exist at the time when Goa came under Portuguese rule. [ 23 ] When the Portuguese government refused to respond to subsequent aide-mémoires in this regard, the Indian government, on 11 June 1953, withdrew its diplomatic mission from Lisbon. [ 24 ] By 1954, the Republic of India instituted visa restrictions on travel from Goa to India which paralysed transport between Goa and other exclaves like Daman, Diu, Dadra and Nagar Haveli. [ 22 ] In the same year, India instituted sanctions on Portugal with the aim of the annexation of Goa into India; the sanction would remain until 1961. [ 25 ] Meanwhile, the Indian Union of Dockers had, in 1954, instituted a boycott on shipping to Portuguese India. [ 26 ] Between 22 July and 2 August 1954, armed activists attacked and forced the surrender of Portuguese forces stationed in Dadra and Nagar Haveli. [ 27 ] On 15 August 1955, 3,000–5,000 unarmed Indian activists [ 28 ] attempted to enter Goa at six locations and were violently repulsed by Portuguese police officers, resulting in the deaths of between 21 [ 29 ] and 30 [ 30 ] people. [ 31 ] The news of the incident built public opinion in India against the presence of the Portuguese in Goa. [ 32 ] On 1 September 1955, India shut its consul office in Goa. [ 33 ] In 1956, the Portuguese ambassador to France, Marcello Mathias, along with Portuguese Prime Minister António de Oliveira Salazar , argued in favour of a referendum in Goa to determine its future. This proposal was however rejected by the Ministers for Defence and Foreign Affairs. The demand for a referendum was repeated by presidential candidate General Humberto Delgado in 1957. [ 22 ] Prime Minister Salazar, alarmed by India's hinted threats at armed action against Portugal's presence in Goa, first asked the United Kingdom to mediate, then protested through Brazil and eventually asked the United Nations Security Council to intervene. [ 34 ] Mexico offered the Indian government its influence in Latin America to bring pressure on the Portuguese to relieve tensions. [ 35 ] Meanwhile, Krishna Menon , India's defence minister and head of India's UN delegation, stated in no uncertain terms that India had not ""abjured the use of force"" in Goa. [ 34 ] The US ambassador to India, John Kenneth Galbraith , requested the Indian government on several occasions to resolve the issue peacefully through mediation and consensus rather than armed conflict. [ 36 ] [ 37 ] On 24 November 1961, Sabarmati , a passenger boat passing between the Indian port of Kochi and the Portuguese-held island of Anjidiv , was fired upon by Portuguese ground troops, resulting in the death of a passenger and injuries to the chief engineer . The action was precipitated by Portuguese fears that the boat carried a military landing party intent on storming the island. [ 38 ] The incidents lent themselves to fostering widespread public support in India for military action in Goa. Eventually, on 10 December, nine days prior to the armed action, code named Operation Vijay, Nehru stated to the press: ""Continuance of Goa under Portuguese rule is an impossibility"". [ 34 ] The American response was to warn India that if and when India's armed action in Goa was brought to the UN Security Council, it could expect no support from the US delegation. [ 39 ] Annexation of Dadra and Nagar Haveli [ edit ] Main article: Annexation of Dadra and Nagar Haveli The hostilities between India and Portugal started seven years before the annexation of Goa, when Dadra and Nagar Haveli were invaded and occupied by pro-Indian forces with the support of the Indian authorities. [ 40 ] Dadra and Nagar Haveli were two Portuguese landlocked exclaves of the Daman district , totally surrounded by Indian territory. The connection between the exclaves and the coastal territory of Daman had to be made by crossing about 20 kilometres (12 mi) of Indian territory. Dadra and Nagar Haveli did not have any Portuguese military garrison, but only police forces. The Indian government started to develop isolation actions against Dadra and Nagar Haveli already in 1952, including the creation of impediments to the transit of persons and goods between the two landlocked enclaves and Daman; [ 41 ] the use of these economic warfare tactics by India caused a deep economic depression in Goa with subsequent hardship for the inhabitants and, in attempt to remedy the situation and with land travel precluded, Salazar established a new airline to communicate the enclaves of Portuguese India with its ports. [ 42 ] In July 1954, pro-Indian forces, including members of organisations like the United Front of Goans, the National Movement Liberation Organisation, the Communist Party of India , the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh and the Azad Gomantak Dal , with the support of Indian Police forces, began to launch assaults against Dadra and Nagar Haveli. On the night of 22 July, UFG forces stormed the small Dadra police station, killing Police Sergeant Aniceto do Rosário and Constable António Fernandes, who resisted the attack. On 28 July, RSS forces took Naroli police station. [ 40 ] Meanwhile, the Portuguese authorities asked the Indian Government for permission to cross the Indian territory with reinforcements to Dadra and Nagar Haveli, but no permission was given. [ 43 ] Surrounded and prevented from receiving reinforcements by the Indian authorities, the Portuguese Administrator and police forces in Nagar Haveli eventually surrendered to the Indian police forces on 11 August 1954. Portugal appealed to the International Court of Justice , which, in a decision dated 12 April 1960, [ 44 ] stated that Portugal had sovereign rights over the territories of Dadra and Nagar Haveli but India had the right to deny passage to armed personnel of Portugal over Indian territories. Therefore, the Portuguese authorities could not legally pass through Indian territory. Events preceding the hostilities [ edit ] Indian military build-up [ edit ] On receiving Krishna Menon's order to initiate military action and capture of all occupied territories for the Indian government, Lieutenant-General Chaudhari of the Indian Army 's Southern Command fielded the 17th Infantry Division commanded by Major General K. P. Candeth and the 50th Parachute Brigade commanded by Brigadier Sagat Singh . The assault on the enclave of Daman was assigned to the 1st battalion of the Maratha Light Infantry while the operations in Diu were assigned to the 20th battalion of the Rajput Regiment and the 5th battalion of the Madras Regiment . [ 45 ] Meanwhile, the Commander-in-Chief of India's Western Air Command , Air Vice Marshal Erlic Pinto , was appointed as the commander of all air resources assigned to the operations in Goa. Air resources for the assault on Goa were concentrated in the bases at Pune and Sambra ( Belgaum ). [ 45 ] The mandate handed to Pinto by the Indian Air Command was listed out as follows: The destruction of Goa's lone airfield in Dabolim , without causing damage to the terminal building and other airport facilities. Destruction of the wireless station at Bambolim , Goa. Denial of airfields at Daman and Diu, which were, however, not to be attacked without prior permission. Support to advancing ground troops. The Indian Navy deployed two warships—the INS Rajput , an 'R' Class destroyer, and INS Kirpan , a Blackwood class anti-submarine frigate—off the coast of Goa. The actual attack on Goa was delegated to four task groups: a Surface Action Group comprising five ships: Mysore , Trishul , Betwa , Beas and Kaveri ; a Carrier Group of five ships: Delhi , Kuthar , Kirpan , Khukri and Rajput centred on the light aircraft carrier Vikrant ; a Mine Sweeping Group consisting of mine sweepers including Karwar , Kakinada , Cannonore and Bimlipatan , and a Support Group which consisted of Dharini . [ 46 ] Portuguese mandate [ edit ] In March 1960, Portuguese Defence Minister General Júlio Botelho Moniz told Prime Minister Salazar that a sustained Portuguese campaign against decolonisation would create for the army ""a suicide mission in which we could not succeed"". His opinion was shared by Army Minister Colonel Afonso Magalhães de Almeida Fernandes , by the Army under secretary of State Lieutenant-Colonel Francisco da Costa Gomes and by other top officers. [ 47 ] Ignoring this advice, Salazar sent a message to Governor General Manuel António Vassalo e Silva in Goa on 14 December, in which he ordered the Portuguese forces in Goa to fight to the last man: ""Do not expect the possibility of truce or of Portuguese prisoners, as there will be no surrender rendered because I feel that our soldiers and sailors can be either victorious or dead."" [ 48 ] Salazar asked Vassalo e Silva to hold out for at least eight days, within which time he hoped to gather international support against the Indian invasion. Vassalo e Silva disobeyed Salazar to avoid the unnecessary loss of human lives and surrendered the day after the Indian invasion. [ 48 ] Portuguese military preparations [ edit ] Portuguese military preparations began in 1954, following the Indian economic blockade, the beginning of the anti-Portuguese attacks in Goa and the annexation of Dadra and Nagar Haveli. Three light infantry battalions (one each sent from Portugal, Angola and Mozambique) and support units were transported to Goa, reinforcing a locally raised battalion and increasing the Portuguese military presence there from almost nothing to 12,000 men. [ 21 ] Other sources state that, at the end of 1955, Portuguese forces in India represented a total of around 8,000 men (Europeans, Africans and Indians), including 7,000 in the land forces, 250 in the naval forces, 600 in the police and 250 in the Fiscal Guard, split between the districts of Goa, Daman and Diu. [ 49 ] Following the annexation of Dadra and Nagar Haveli, the Portuguese authorities markedly strengthened the garrison of Portuguese India, with units and personnel sent from the Metropole and from the Portuguese African provinces of Angola and Mozambique . The Portuguese forces were organised as the Armed Forces of the State of India (FAEI, Forças Armadas do Estado da Índia ), under a unified command headed by General Paulo Bénard Guedes , who combined the civil role of Governor-General with the military role of Commander-in-Chief. Guedes ended his commission in 1958, with General Vassalo e Silva being appointed to replace him in both the civil and military roles. [ 49 ] The Portuguese government and military commands were, however, well aware that even with this effort to strengthen the garrison of Goa, the Portuguese forces would never be sufficient to face a conventional attack from the overwhelmingly stronger Indian Armed Forces. The Portuguese government hoped however to politically deter the Indian government from attempting a military aggression through the showing of a strong will to fight and to sacrifice to defend Goa. [ 49 ] In 1960, during an inspection visit to Portuguese India and referring to a predictable start of guerrilla activities in Angola , the Under Secretary of State of the Army, Francisco da Costa Gomes , stated the necessity to reinforce the Portuguese military presence in that African territory, partly at the expense of the military presence in Goa, where the then existing 7,500 men were too many just to deal with anti-Portuguese actions, and too few to face an Indian invasion, which, if it were to occur, would have to be handled by other means. This led to the Portuguese forces in India suffering a sharp reduction to about 3,300 soldiers. [ 49 ] Faced with this reduced force strength, the strategy employed to defend Goa against an Indian invasion was based on the Plano Sentinela (Sentinel Plan), which divided the territory into four defence sectors (North, Center, South and Mormugão), and the Plano de Barragens (Barrage Plan), which envisaged the demolition of all bridges to delay the invading army, as well as the mining of approach roads and beaches. Defence units were organised as four battlegroups ( agrupamentos ), with one assigned to each sector and tasked with slowing the progress of an invading force. Then-Captain Carlos Azaredo, who was stationed in Goa at the time of hostilities, described the Plano Sentinela in the Portuguese newspaper Expresso on 8 December 2001 as ""a totally unrealistic and unachievable plan, which was quite incomplete. It was based on exchange of ground with time. But, for this purpose, portable communication equipment was necessary."" [ 21 ] The plans to mine roads and beaches were also unviable because of an insufficient quantity of mines. [ 50 ] Navy [ edit ] The naval component of the FAEI were the Naval Forces of the State of India (FNEI, Forças Navais do Estado da Índia ), headed by the Naval Commander of Goa, Commodore Raúl Viegas Ventura. The only significant Portuguese Navy warship present in Goa at the time of invasion was the sloop NRP Afonso de Albuquerque . [ 51 ] It was armed with four 120 mm guns capable of two shots per minute, and four automatic rapid-firing guns. In addition to the sloop, the Portuguese Naval Forces had three light patrol boats ( lanchas de fiscalização ), each armed with a 20 mm Oerlikon gun, one based in each of Goa, Daman and Diu. There were also five merchant marine ships in Goa. [ 52 ] An attempt by Portugal to send naval warships to Goa to reinforce its marine defences was foiled when President Gamal Abdel Nasser of Egypt denied the ships access to the Suez Canal . [ 53 ] [ 54 ] [ 55 ] Ground forces [ edit ] Portuguese ground defences were organised as the Land Forces of the State of India (FTEI, Forças Terrestres do Estado da Índia ), under the Portuguese Army 's Independent Territorial Command of India, headed by Brigadier António José Martins Leitão. At the time of the invasion, they consisted of a total of 3,995 men, including 810 native (Indo-Portuguese) soldiers, many of whom had little military training and were utilised primarily for security and anti-extremist operations. These forces were divided amongst the three Portuguese enclaves in India. [ 49 ] The Portuguese Army units in Goa included four motorised reconnaissance squadrons, eight rifle companies ( caçadores ), two artillery batteries and an engineer detachment. In addition to the military forces, the Portuguese defences counted on the civil internal security forces of Portuguese India. These included the State of India Police (PEI, Polícia do Estado da Índia ), a general police corps modelled after the Portuguese Public Security Police ; the Fiscal Guard ( Guarda Fiscal ), responsible for Customs enforcement and border protection; and the Rural Guard ( Guarda Rural ), game wardens. In 1958, as an emergency measure, the Portuguese government gave provisional military status to the PEI and the Fiscal Guard, placing them under the command of the FAEI. The security forces were also divided amongst the three districts and were mostly made up of Indo-Portuguese policemen and guards. Different sources indicate between 900 and 1400 men as the total effective strength of these forces at the time of the invasion. [ 49 ] Air defence [ edit ] The Portuguese Air Force did not have any presence in Portuguese India, with the exception of a single officer with the role of air adviser in the office of the Commander-in-Chief. [ 49 ] On 16 December, the Portuguese Air Force was placed on alert to transport ten tonnes of anti-tank grenades in two Douglas DC-6 aircraft from Montijo Air Base in Portugal to Goa to assist in its defence. When the Portuguese Air Force was unable to obtain stopover facilities at any air base along the way because most countries, including Pakistan, denied passage of Portuguese military aircraft, the mission was passed to the Portuguese international civilian airline TAP , which offered a Lockheed Constellation (registration CS-TLA) on charter. However, when permission to transport weapons through Karachi was denied by the Pakistani government , the Constellation landed in Goa at 18:00 on 17 December with a consignment of half a dozen bags of sausages as food supplies instead of the intended grenades. In addition it transported a contingent of female paratroopers to assist in the evacuation of Portuguese civilians. [ 56 ] The Portuguese air presence in Goa at the time of hostilities was thus limited to the presence of two civilian transport aircraft, the Lockheed Constellation belonging to TAP and a Douglas DC-4 Skymaster belonging to the Goan airline Portuguese India Airlines . The Indians claimed that the Portuguese had a squadron of F-86 Sabres stationed at Dabolim Airport —which later turned out to be false intelligence. Air defence was limited to a few obsolete anti-aircraft guns manned by two artillery units who had been smuggled into Goa disguised as football teams. [ 38 ] Portuguese civilian evacuation [ edit ] The military buildup created panic amongst Europeans in Goa, who were desperate to evacuate their families before the commencement of hostilities. On 9 December, the vessel India arrived at Goa's Mormugão port en route to Lisbon from Timor . Despite orders from the Portuguese government in Lisbon not to allow anyone to embark on this vessel, Governor General Manuel Vassalo e Silva allowed 700 Portuguese civilians of European origin to board the ship and flee Goa. The ship had capacity for only 380 passengers, and was filled to its limits, with evacuees occupying even the toilets. [ 38 ] On arranging this evacuation of women and children, Vassalo e Silva remarked to the press, ""If necessary, we will die here."" Evacuation of European civilians continued by air even after the commencement of Indian air strikes. [ 57 ] Indian reconnaissance operations [ edit ] Indian reconnaissance operations had commenced on 1 December, when two Leopard class frigates , the INS Betwa and the INS Beas , undertook linear patrolling of the Goa coast at a distance of 8 miles (13 km). By 8 December, the Indian Air Force had commenced baiting missions and fly-bys to lure out Portuguese air defences and fighters. [ citation needed ] On 17 December, a tactical reconnaissance flight conducted by Squadron Leader I. S. Loughran in a Vampire NF54 Night Fighter over Dabolim Airport in Goa was met with five rounds fired from a ground anti-aircraft gun. The aircraft took evasive action by drastically dropping altitude and escaping out to sea. The anti-aircraft gun was later recovered near the ATC building with a round jammed in its breech. [ 58 ] The Indian light aircraft carrier INS Vikrant was deployed 75 miles (121 km) from the coast of Goa to head off a possible amphibious operation on Goa and deter any foreign military intervention. Commencement of hostilities [ edit ] Military actions in Goa [ edit ] Ground attack on Goa: North and North East sectors [ edit ] On 11 December 1961, 17th Infantry Division and attached troops of the Indian Army were ordered to advance into Goa to capture Panaji and Mormugão. The main thrust on Panaji was to be made by the 50th Para Brigade Group , led by Brigadier Sagat Singh from the north. Another thrust was to be carried out by 63rd Indian Infantry Brigade from the east. A deceptive thrust , in company strength, was to be made from the south along the Majali-Canacona-Margao axis. [ 59 ] Although the 50th Para Brigade was charged with merely assisting the main thrust conducted by the 17th Infantry, its units moved rapidly across minefields, roadblocks and four riverine obstacles to be the first to reach Panaji. [ 60 ] Hostilities at Goa began at 09:45 on 17 December 1961, when a unit of Indian troops attacked and occupied the town of Maulinguém in the north east, killing two Portuguese soldiers. The Portuguese 2nd EREC ( esquadrão de reconhecimento — reconnaissance squadron), stationed near Maulinguém, asked for permission to engage the Indians, but permission was refused at about 13:45. [ 61 ] During the afternoon of the 17th, the Portuguese command issued instructions that all orders to defending troops would be issued directly by headquarters, bypassing the local command outposts. This led to confusion in the chain of command. [ 61 ] At 02:00 on 18 December, the 2nd EREC was sent to the town of Doromagogo to support the withdrawal of police forces present in the area, and were attacked by Indian Army units on their return journey. [ 61 ] At 04:00, the Indian assault commenced with artillery bombardment on Portuguese positions south of Maulinguém, launched on the basis of the false intelligence that the Portuguese had stationed heavy battle tanks in the area. By 04:30, Bicholim was under fire. At 04:40, the Portuguese forces destroyed the bridge at Bicholim and followed this with the destruction of the bridges at Chapora in Colvale and at Assonora at 05:00. [ 61 ] On the morning of 18 December, the 50th Para Brigade of the Indian Army moved into Goa in three columns. The eastern column comprised the 2nd Para Maratha advanced towards the town of Ponda in central Goa via Usgão. The central column consisting of the 1st Para Punjab advanced towards Panaji via the village of Banastari. The western column—the main thrust of the attack—comprised the 2nd Sikh Light Infantry as well as an armoured division which crossed the border at 06:30 and advanced on Tivim . [ 59 ] At 05:30, Portuguese troops left their barracks at Ponda in central Goa and marched towards the town of Usgão, in the direction of the advancing eastern column of the Indian 2nd Para Maratha, which was under the command of Major Dalip Singh Jind and included M4 Sherman tanks of the Indian 7th Cavalry . At 09:00, these Portuguese troops reported that Indian troops had already covered half the distance to the town of Ponda. [ 61 ] [ 62 ] By 10:00, Portuguese forces of the 1st EREC, faced with the advancing 2nd Sikh Light Infantry, began a south-bound withdrawal to the town of Mapuca where, by 12:00, they came under the risk of being surrounded by Indian forces. At 12:30, the 1st EREC began a retreat, making their way through the Indian forces, with their armoured cars firing ahead to cover the withdrawal of the personnel carrier vehicles. This unit relocated by ferry further south to the capital city of Panaji. [ 61 ] At 13:30, just after the retreat of the 2nd EREC, the Portuguese destroyed the bridge at Banastarim, cutting off all road links to Panaji. By 17:45, the forces of the 1st EREC and the 9th Caçadores Company of the Portuguese Battlegroup North had completed their ferry crossing of the Mandovi River to Panaji, just minutes ahead of the arrival of the Indian armoured forces. [ 61 ] The Indian tanks had reached Betim, just across the Mandovi River from Panaji, without encountering any opposition. The 2nd Sikh Light Infantry joined it by 21:00, crossing over mines and demolished bridges en route. In the absence of orders, the unit stayed at Betim for the night. At 20:00, a Goan by the name of Gregório Magno Antão crossed the Mandovi River from Panaji and delivered a ceasefire offer letter from Major Acácio Tenreiro of the Portuguese Army to Major Shivdev Singh Sidhu, the commanding officer of the Indian 7th Cavalry camped there. The letter read: ""The Military Commander of the City of Goa states that he wishes to parley with the commander of the army of the Indian Union with respect to the surrender. Under these conditions, the Portuguese troops must immediately cease fire and the Indian troops do likewise in order to prevent the slaughter of the population and the destruction of the city."" [ 63 ] The same night Major Shivdev Singh Sidhu with a force of the 7th Cavalry decided to take Fort Aguada and obtain its surrender, after receiving information that a number of supporters of the Indian Republic were held prisoners there. However, the Portuguese defenders of the fort had not yet received orders to surrender and responded by opening fire on the Indian forces, Major Sidhu and Captain Vinod Sehgal being killed in the firefight. [ 59 ] The order for Indian forces to cross the Mandovi River was received on the morning of 19 December, upon which two rifle companies of the 2nd Sikh Light Infantry advanced on Panaji at 07:30 and secured the town without facing any resistance. On orders from Brigadier Sagat Singh , the troops entering Panaji removed their steel helmets and donned the Parachute Regiment 's maroon berets . Fort Aguada was also captured on that day, when the Indian 7th Cavalry attacked with assistance from the armoured division stationed at Betim and freed its political prisoners. Advance from the east [ edit ] This section does not cite any sources . Please help improve this section by adding citations to reliable sources . Unsourced material may be challenged and removed . ( May 2018 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) Meanwhile, in the east, the 63rd Indian Infantry Brigade advanced in two columns. The right column, consisting of the 2nd Bihar Battalion , and the left column, consisting of the 3rd Sikh Battalion , linked up at the border town of Mollem and then advanced by separate routes on Ponda. By nightfall, the 2nd Bihar had reached the town of Candeapur, while the 3rd Sikh had reached Darbondara. Although neither column had encountered any resistance, their further progress was hampered because all bridges spanning the river had been destroyed. The rear battalion was the 4th Sikh Infantry , which reached Candeapar in the early hours of 19 December, and not to be bogged down by the destruction of the Borim Bridge, went across the Zuari River in their military tankers and then waded through chest-high water across a small stream to reach a dock known as Embarcadouro de Tembim in the village of Raia , from where a road connects to Margão , the administrative centre of southern Goa. Their rear battalion took some rest in a cattle shed and on the grounds and the balcony of an adjacent house before proceeding to Margão by 12:00. From here, the column advanced towards the harbour of Mormugão. En route they encountered fierce resistance from a 500-strong Portuguese unit at the village of Verna , where they were joined by the 2nd Bihar. The Portuguese unit surrendered at 15:30 after fierce fighting, and the 4th Sikh then proceeded to Mormugão and Dabolim Airport, where the main body of the Portuguese Army awaited the Indians. The 4th Rajput company staged a decoy attack south of Margão in order to mislead the Portuguese. This column overcame minefields, roadblocks and demolished bridges, and eventually went on to help secure the town of Margão. Air raids over Goa [ edit ] A Canberra bomber of the Indian Air Force. The Indian Air Force used 20 small and lightweight Canberra bombers. The first Indian raid was led by Wing Commander N.B. Menon on 18 December on the Dabolim Airport using 12 English Electric Canberra aircraft. 63,000 pounds of explosives were dropped within minutes, completely destroying the runway. In line with the mandate given by the Air Command, structures and facilities at the airfield were left undamaged. [ 45 ] The second Indian raid was conducted on the same target by eight Canberras led by Wing Commander Surinder Singh, again leaving the airport's terminal and other buildings untouched. Two civilian transport aircraft—a Lockheed Constellation belonging to the Portuguese airline TAP and a Douglas DC-4 belonging to the Goan airline TAIP—were parked on the apron. On the night of 18 December, the Portuguese used both aircraft to evacuate the families of some government and military officials after airport workers had hastily recovered part of the heavily damaged runway that evening. The first aircraft to leave was the TAP Constellation, commanded by Manuel Correia Reis, which took off using only 700 metres; debris from the runway damaged the fuselage, causing 25 holes and a flat tire. To make the 'short take-off' possible, the pilots had jettisoned all the extra seats and other unwanted equipment. [ 64 ] The TAIP DC-4 then also took off, piloted by TAIP Director Major Solano de Almeida. The two aircraft successfully used the cover of night and very low altitudes to break through Indian aerial patrols and escape to Karachi, Pakistan. [ 65 ] A third Indian raid was carried out by six Hawker Hunters , successfully targeting the wireless station at Bambolim with rockets and autocannons. The mandate to support ground troops was served by the de Havilland Vampires of No. 45 squadron, which patrolled the sector but did not receive any requests into action. In an incident of friendly fire, two Vampires fired rockets into the positions of the 2nd Sikh Light Infantry , injuring two soldiers, while elsewhere, Indian ground troops mistakenly opened fire on an IAF T-6 Texan , causing minimal damage. In later years, commentators have maintained that India's intense air strikes against the airfields were uncalled-for, since none of the targeted airports had any military capabilities and they did not cater to any military aircraft. As such, the airfields were defenceless civilian targets. [ 65 ] The Indian navy continues to control the Dabolim Airport, although it is also once more used as a civilian airport. Storming of Anjidiv Island [ edit ] This section does not cite any sources . Please help improve this section by adding citations to reliable sources . Unsourced material may be challenged and removed . ( May 2018 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) Anjidiv was a small 1.5 km 2 island of Portuguese India, then almost uninhabited, belonging to the District of Goa, although off the coast of the Indian state of Karnataka . On the island stood the 16th Century Anjidiv Fort , defended by a platoon of Goan soldiers of the Portuguese Army. The Indian Naval Command assigned the task of securing Anjidiv to the cruiser INS Mysore and the frigate INS Trishul . Under covering artillery fire from the ships, Indian marines under the command of Lieutenant Arun Auditto stormed the island at 14:25 on 18 December and engaged the Portuguese garrison. The assault was repulsed by the Portuguese defenders, with seven Indian marines killed and 19 wounded. Among the Indian casualties were two officers. The Portuguese defences were eventually overrun after fierce shelling from the Indian ships offshore. The island was secured by the Indians at 14:00 on the next day, all the Portuguese defenders being captured with the exception of two corporals and one private. Hidden in the rocks, one corporal surrendered on 19 December. The other was captured in the afternoon of 20 December, but not before launching hand grenades that injured several Indian marines. The last of the three, Goan private Manuel Caetano, became the last Portuguese soldier in India to be captured, on 22 December, after he had reached the Indian shore by swimming. Naval battle at Mormugão harbour [ edit ] The NRP Afonso de Albuquerque On the morning of 18 December, the Portuguese sloop NRP Afonso de Albuquerque was anchored off Mormugao Harbour. Besides engaging Indian naval units, the ship was also tasked with providing a coastal artillery battery to defend the harbour and adjoining beaches, and providing vital radio communications with Lisbon after on-shore radio facilities had been destroyed in Indian airstrikes. At 09:00, three Indian frigates led by the INS Betwa (F139) , commanded by Commander R.K.S. Ghandhi , took up position off the harbour, awaiting orders to attack the Afonso and secure sea access to the port. At 11:00, Indian planes bombed Mormugão harbour. [ 3 ] At 12:00, upon receiving clearance, the INS Betwa and the INS Beas (F137) entered the harbour and fired on the Afonso with their 4.5-inch guns while transmitting requests to surrender in morse code between shots. In response, the Afonso lifted anchor, headed out towards the enemy and returned fire with its 120 mm guns. The Afonso was outnumbered by the Indians, and was at a severe disadvantage since it was in a confined position that restricted its maneuvering, and because its four 120mm guns could fire only two rounds a minute, as compared to the 16 rounds per minute of the guns aboard the Indian frigates. A few minutes into the exchange of fire, at 12:15, the Afonso took a direct hit in its control tower, injuring its weapons officer. At 12:25, an anti-personnel shrapnel bomb fired from an Indian vessel exploded directly over the ship, killing its radio officer and severely injuring its commander, Captain António da Cunha Aragão, after which First Officer Pinto da Cruz took command of the vessel. The ship's propulsion system was also badly damaged in this attack. At 12:35, the Afonso swerved 180 degrees and was run aground against Bambolim beach. At that time, against the commander's orders, a white flag was hoisted under instructions from the sergeant in charge of signals, but the flag coiled itself around the mast and as a result was not spotted by the Indians, who continued their barrage. The flag was immediately lowered. Eventually at 12:50, after the Afonso had fired nearly 400 rounds at the Indian soldiers, hitting two of the Indian vessels, and had taken severe damage, the order was given to start abandoning ship. Under heavy fire directed at both the ship and the coast, non-essential crew including weapons staff left the ship and went ashore. They were followed at 13:10 by the rest of the crew, who, along with their injured commander, set fire to the ship and disembarked directly onto the beach. Following this, the commander was transferred by car to the hospital at Panaji. [ 3 ] On the Indian Union side, two frigates were hit, killing five sailors and injuring thirteen. [ 66 ] The sloop's crew formally surrendered with the remaining Portuguese forces on 19 December 1961 at 20:30. [ 21 ] As a gesture of goodwill, the commanders of the INS Betwa and the INS Beas later visited Captain Aragão as he lay recuperating in bed in Panaji. The Afonso —having been renamed Saravastri by the Indian Navy—lay grounded at the beach near Dona Paula until 1962, when it was towed to Bombay and sold for scrap. Parts of the ship were recovered and are on display at the Naval Museum in Mumbai. [ 3 ] The Portuguese patrol boat NRP Sirius , under the command of Lieutenant Marques Silva, was also present at Goa. After observing Afonso running aground and not having communications from the Goa Naval Command, Lieutenant Marques Silva decided to scuttle the Sirius . This was done by damaging the propellers and making the boat hit the rocks. The eight men of the Sirius ' s crew avoided being captured by the Indian forces and boarded a Greek freighter on which they reached Pakistan. Military actions in Daman [ edit ] Ground attack on Daman [ edit ] Daman , approximately 72 km 2 in area, is at the south end of Gujarat bordering Maharashtra , approximately 193 km north of Bombay. The countryside is broken and interspersed with marsh, salt pans, streams, paddy fields, coconut and palm groves. The river Daman Ganga splits the capital city of Daman (Damão in Portuguese) into halves—Nani Daman ( Damão Pequeno ) and Moti Daman ( Damão Grande ). The strategically important features were Daman Fort (fortress of São Jerónimo) and the air control tower of Daman Airport . [ 67 ] The Portuguese garrison in Daman was headed by Major António José da Costa Pinto (combining the roles of District Governor and military commander), with 360 soldiers of the Portuguese Army, 200 policemen and about 30 customs officials under him. The army forces consisted of two companies of caçadores (light infantry) and an artillery battery, organised as the battlegroup "" Constantino de Bragança "". The artillery battery was armed with 87.6 mm guns, but these had insufficient and old ammunition. The Portuguese also placed a 20 mm anti-aircraft gun ten days before the invasion to protect the artillery. Daman had been secured with small minefields and defensive shelters had been built. [ 52 ] The advance on the enclave of Daman was conducted by the 1st Maratha Light Infantry Battalion under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel S.J.S. Bhonsle [ 67 ] in a pre-dawn operation on 18 December. [ 59 ] The plan was to capture Daman piecemeal in four phases, starting with the area of the airfield, then progressively the open countryside, Damão Pequeno and finally Damão Grande including the fort. [ 67 ] The advance commenced at 04:00 when one battalion and three companies of Indian soldiers progressed through the central area of the northern territory, aiming to seize the airfield. [ 52 ] However, the surprise was lost when the Indian A Company tried to capture the control tower and suffered three casualties. The Portuguese lost one soldier dead and six taken captive. The Indian D Company captured a position named ""Point 365"" just before the next morning. At the crack of dawn, two sorties by Indian Air Force Mystère fighters struck Portuguese mortar positions and guns inside Moti Daman Fort. [ 67 ] At 04:30, the Indian artillery began to bombard Damão Grande. The artillery attack and transportation difficulties isolated the Portuguese command post there from the forces in Damão Pequeno. At 07:30, a Portuguese unit at the fortress of São Jerónimo fired mortars on Indian forces attempting to capture the airstrip. [ 52 ] At 11:30, Portuguese forces resisting an Indian advance on the eastern border at Varacunda ran out of ammunition and withdrew westwards to Catra. At 12:00, to delay the Indian advance following the withdrawal from Varacunda, the Portuguese artillery battery on the banks of the Daman Ganga River was ordered to open fire. The commander of the battery, Captain Felgueiras de Sousa, instead dismantled the guns and surrendered to the Indians. [ 52 ] By 12:00, the airfield was assaulted by the Indian A and C companies simultaneously. In the ensuing exchange of fire the A Company lost one more soldier and seven were wounded. [ 67 ] By 13:00, the remaining Portuguese forces on the east border at Calicachigão exhausted their ammunition and retreated towards the coast. By 17:00, in the absence of resistance, the Indians had managed to occupy most of the territory, except the airfield and Damão Pequeno, where the Portuguese were making their last stand. By this time, the Indian Air Force had conducted six air attacks, severely demoralising the Portuguese forces. At 20:00, after a meeting between the Portuguese commanders, a delegation was dispatched to the Indian lines to open negotiations, but was fired on, and was forced to withdraw. A similar attempt by the artillery to surrender at 08:00 next day was also fired on. [ 52 ] The Indians assaulted the airfield the next morning, upon which the Portuguese surrendered at 11:00 without a fight. [ 59 ] Garrison commander Major Costa Pinto, although wounded, was stretchered to the airfield, as the Indians were only willing to accept a surrender from him. [ 52 ] Approximately 600 Portuguese soldiers and policemen (including 24 officers [ 67 ] ) were taken prisoner. The Indians suffered 4 dead and 14 wounded, [ 67 ] while the Portuguese suffered 10 dead and two wounded. [ 59 ] The 1st Light Maratha Infantry was decorated for the battle with one Vishisht Seva Medal (VSM) for the commanding officer, two Sena Medals and five mentioned in dispatches. [ 67 ] Daman air raids [ edit ] In the Daman sector, Indian Mystères flew 14 sorties, continuously harassing Portuguese artillery positions. Naval action at Daman [ edit ] This section does not cite any sources . Please help improve this section by adding citations to reliable sources . Unsourced material may be challenged and removed . ( May 2018 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) Like the Vega in Diu, the patrol boat NRP Antares —based at Daman under the command of 2nd Lieutenant Abreu Brito—was ordered to sail out and fight the imminent Indian invasion. The boat stayed in position from 07:00 on 18 December and remained a mute witness to repeated air strikes followed by ground invasion until 19:20, when it lost all communications with land. With all information pointing to total occupation of all Portuguese enclaves in India, Lieutenant Brito decided to save his crew and vessel by escaping; the Vega traversed 530 miles (850 km), escaping detection by Indian forces, and arrived at Karachi at 20:00 on 20 December. Military actions in Diu [ edit ] Ground attack on Diu [ edit ] Diu is a 13.8 km by 4.6 km island (area about 40 km 2 ) at the south tip of Gujarat. The island is separated from the mainland by a narrow channel running through a swamp. The channel could only be used by fishing boats and small craft. No bridges crossed the channels at the time of hostilities. The Portuguese garrison in Diu was headed by Major Fernando de Almeida e Vasconcelos (district governor and military commander), with around 400 soldiers and police officers, organised as the battlegroup ""António da Silveira"". [ 68 ] Diu was attacked on 18 December from the north west along Kob Forte by two companies of the 20th Rajput Battalion —with the capture of the Diu Airfield being the primary objective—and from the northeast along Gogal and Amdepur by the Rajput B Company and the 4th Madras Battalion . [ 59 ] These Indian Army units ignored requests from Wing Commander M.P.O. ""Micky"" Blake, planning-in-charge of the Indian Air Force operations in Diu, to attack only on first light when close air support would be available. [ 68 ] The Portuguese defences repulsed the attack backed by 87.6mm artillery and mortars, [ 52 ] inflicting heavy losses on the Indians. [ 68 ] The first attack was made by the 4th Madras on a police border post at 01:30 on 18 December at Gogol and was repulsed by 13 Portuguese police officers. [ 52 ] Another attempt by the 4th Madras at 02:00 was again repulsed, this time backed with Portuguese 87.5mm artillery and mortar which suffered due to poor quality of munitions. By 04:00, ten of the original 13 Portuguese defenders at Gogol had been wounded and were evacuated to a hospital. At 05:30, the Portuguese artillery launched a fresh attack on the 4th Madras assaulting Gogol and forced their retreat. [ 52 ] Meanwhile, at 03:00, two companies of the 20th Rajput attempted to cross a muddy swamp [ 52 ] separating them from the Portuguese forces at Passo Covo under cover of dark on rafts made of bamboo cots tied to oil barrels. [ 68 ] The attempt was to establish a bridgehead and capture the airfield. [ 59 ] This attack was repulsed, with losses on the Indian side, by a well entrenched unit of Portuguese soldiers armed with small automatic weapons, sten guns [ 68 ] as well as light and medium machine guns. According to Indian sources this unit included between 125 and 130 soldiers, [ 59 ] but according to Portuguese sources this post was defended by only eight soldiers, [ 52 ] but this number doesn't support the total number of weapon operators. As the Rajputs reached the middle of the creek, the Portuguese on Diu opened fire with two medium and two light machine-guns, capsizing some of the rafts. Major Mal Singh of the Indian Army along with five men pressed on his advance and crossed the creek. On reaching the far bank, he and his men assaulted the light machine gun trenches at Fort-De-Cova and eliminated the weapon operators. The Portuguese medium machine gun fire from another position wounded the officer and two of his men. However, with the efforts of company Havildar Major Mohan Singh and two other men, the three wounded were evacuated back across the creek to safety. As dawn approached, the Portuguese increased the intensity of fire and the battalion's water crossing equipment suffered extensive damage. As a result, the Indian battalion was ordered to fall back to Kob village by first light. [ 67 ] Another assault at 05:00 was similarly repulsed by the Portuguese defenders. At 06:30, Portuguese forces retrieved rafts abandoned by the 20th Rajput, recovered ammunition left behind and rescued a wounded Indian soldier, who was given treatment. [ 52 ] At 07:00, with the onset of dawn, Indian air strikes began, forcing the Portuguese to retreat from Passo Covo to the town of Malala. By 09:00 the Portuguese unit at Gogol also retreated, [ 52 ] allowing the Rajput B Company (who replaced the 4th Madras) to advance under heavy artillery fire and occupy the town. [ 59 ] By 10:15, the Indian cruiser INS Delhi , anchored off Diu, began to bombard targets on the shore. [ 52 ] At 12:45, Indian jets fired a rocket at a mortar at Diu Fortress causing a fire near a munitions dump , forcing the Portuguese to order the evacuation of the fortress—a task completed by 14:15 under heavy bombardment from India. [ 52 ] At 18:00, the Portuguese commanders agreed in a meeting that in view of repeated military advances with naval and air strikes, along with the inability to establish contact with headquarters in Goa or Lisbon, there was no way to pursue an effective defence and decided to surrender to the Indian military. [ 52 ] On 19 December, by 12:00, the Portuguese formally surrendered. 403 prisoners were taken, which included the Governor of the island along with 18 officers and 43 sergeants. [ 67 ] Seven Portuguese soldiers had been killed in the battle. [ 68 ] When surrendering to the Indians, the Diu Governor stated that he could have stalled the army's advances for a few days to weeks, but he had no answer to the Indian Air Force and Navy. The Indian Air Force was also present at the ceremony and was represented by Gp Capt Godkhindi, Wing Cmdr Micky Blake and Sqn Ldr Nobby Clarke. [ 68 ] Major Mal Singh and Sepoy Hakam Singh of the Indian Army were awarded Ashoka Chakra (Class III). [ 67 ] On 19 December, the 4th Madras C Company landed on the island of Pani Khota off Diu, where a group of 13 Portuguese soldiers surrendered to them there. [ 59 ] The Diu air raids [ edit ] Dassault MD450 Ouragan of the Indian Air Force, this type of aircraft formed the backbone of the air strikes on Diu. The Indian air operations in the Diu Sector were entrusted to the Armaments Training Wing led by Wg Cdr Micky Blake. The first air attacks were made at dawn on 18 December and were aimed at destroying Diu's fortifications facing the mainland. Throughout the rest of the day, the Air Force had at least two aircraft in the air at any time, giving close support to advancing Indian infantry. During the morning, the air force attacked and destroyed Diu Airfield's ATC as well as parts of Diu Fort . On orders from Tactical Air Command located at Pune, a sortie of two Toofanis attacked and destroyed the airfield runway with 4 1000 lb Mk 9 bombs. A second sortie aimed at the runway and piloted by Wg Cdr Blake himself was aborted when Blake detected what he reported as people waving white flags. In subsequent sorties, PM Ramachandran of the Indian Air Force attacked and destroyed the Portuguese ammunition dump as well a patrol boat N.R.P. Vega that attempted to escape from Diu. In the absence of any Portuguese air presence, Portuguese ground-based anti-aircraft units attempted to offer resistance to raids, but were overwhelmed and quickly silenced, leaving complete air superiority to India. Continued attacks forced the Portuguese governor of Diu to surrender. Naval action at Diu [ edit ] The Indian cruiser INS Delhi was anchored off the coast of Diu and fired a barrage from its 6-inch guns at the Portuguese occupied Diu Fortress. The Commanding Officer of the Indian Air Force operating in the area reported that some of the shells fired from the Delhi were bouncing off the beach and exploding on the Indian mainland. However, no casualties were reported from this. At 04:00 on 18 December, the Portuguese patrol boat NRP Vega encountered the Delhi around 12 miles (19 km) off the coast of Diu, and was attacked with heavy machine gun fire. Staying out of range, the boat had no casualties and minimal damage, the boat withdrew to the port at Diu. At 07:00, news was received that the Indian invasion had commenced, and the commander of the Vega , 2nd Lt Oliveira e Carmo was ordered to sail out and fight until the last round of ammunition. At 07:30 the crew of the Vega spotted two Indian aircraft led by Flt. Lt. PM Ramachandran on patrol missions and opened fire on them with the ship's 20mm Oerlikon gun. In retaliation the Indian aircraft attacked the Vega twice, killing the captain and the gunner and forcing the rest of the crew to abandon the boat and swim ashore, where they were taken prisoners of war. [ 69 ] [ 70 ] UN attempts at ceasefire [ edit ] On 18 December, a Portuguese request was made to the UN Security Council for a debate on the conflict in Goa. The request was approved when the bare minimum of seven members supported the request (the US, UK, France, Turkey, Chile, Ecuador, and Nationalist China ), two opposed (the Soviet Union and Ceylon), and two abstained (the United Arab Republic and Liberia). [ 71 ] Opening the debate, Portugal's delegate, Vasco Vieira Garin, said that Portugal had consistently shown her peaceful intentions by refraining from any counter-action to India's numerous ""provocations"" on the Goan border. Garin also stated that Portuguese forces, though ""vastly outnumbered by the invading forces,"" were putting up ""stiff resistance"" and ""fighting a delaying action and destroying communications in order to halt the advance of the enemy."" In response, India's delegate, C. S. Jha said that the ""elimination of the last vestiges of colonialism in India"" was an ""article of faith"" for the Indian people, ""Security Council or no Security Council."" He went on to describe Goa, Daman, and Diu as ""an inalienable part of India unlawfully occupied by Portugal."" [ 71 ] In the ensuing debate, the US delegate, Adlai Stevenson , strongly criticised India's use of force to resolve her dispute with Portugal, stressing that such resort to violent means was against the charter of the UN. He stated that condoning such acts of armed forces would encourage other nations to resort to similar solutions to their own disputes, and would lead to the death of the United Nations. In response, the Soviet delegate, Valerian Zorin , argued that the Goan question was wholly within India's domestic jurisdiction and could not be considered by the Security Council. He also drew attention to Portugal's disregard for UN resolutions calling for the granting of independence to colonial countries and peoples. [ 71 ] Following the debate, the delegates of Liberia, Ceylon and the U.A.R. presented a resolution which: (1) stated that ""the enclaves claimed by Portugal in India constitute a threat to international peace and security and stand in the way of the unity of the Republic of India; (2) asked the security Council to reject the Portuguese charge of aggression against India; and (3) called upon Portugal ""to terminate hostile action and co-operate with India in the liquidation of her colonial possessions in India."" This resolution was supported only by the Soviet Union, the other seven members opposing. [ 71 ] After the defeat of the Afro-Asian resolution, a resolution was presented by France, Turkey, the United Kingdom and the United States which: (1) Called for the immediate cessation of hostilities; (2) Called upon India to withdraw her forces immediately to ""the positions prevailing before 17 Dec 1961."" (3) Urged India and Portugal ""to work out a permanent solution of their differences by peaceful means in accordance with the principles embodied in the Charter""; and (4) Requested the U.N. Secretary-General ""to provide such assistance as may be appropriate."" [ 71 ] This resolution received seven votes in favour (the four sponsors and Chile, Ecuador, and Nationalist China) and four against (the Soviet Union, Ceylon, Liberia, and the United Arab Republic). It was thus defeated by the Soviet veto. In a statement after the vote, Mr. Stevenson said that the ""fateful"" Goa debate might have been ""the first act of a drama"" which could have ended in the death of the United Nations. [ 71 ] Portuguese surrender [ edit ] By the evening of 18 December, most of Goa had been overrun by advancing Indian forces, and a large party of more than two thousand Portuguese soldiers had taken position at the military base at Alparqueiros at the entrance to the port town of Vasco da Gama. Per the Portuguese strategy code named Plano Sentinela the defending forces were to make their last stand at the harbour, holding out against the Indian soldiers until Portuguese naval reinforcements could arrive. Orders delivered from the Portuguese President called for a scorched earth policy—that Goa was to be destroyed before it was given up to India. [ 72 ] Canadian political scientist Antonio Rangel Bandeira has argued that the sacrifice of Goa was an elaborate public relations stunt calculated to rally support for Portugal's wars in Africa. [ 47 ] [ page needed ] Despite his orders from Lisbon , Governor General Manuel António Vassalo e Silva took stock of the numerical superiority of the Indian troops, as well as the food and ammunition supplies available to his forces and took the decision to surrender. He later described his orders to destroy Goa as "" um sacrifício inútil "" (a useless sacrifice). [ citation needed ] In a communication to all Portuguese forces under his command, he stated, ""Having considered the defence of the Peninsula of Mormugão ... from aerial, naval and ground fire of the enemy and ... having considered the difference between the forces and the resources ... the situation does not allow myself to proceed with the fight without great sacrifice of the lives of the inhabitants of Vasco da Gama , I have decided with ... my patriotism well present, to get in touch with the enemy ... I order all my forces to cease-fire."" [ 73 ] The official Portuguese surrender was conducted in a formal ceremony held at 20:30 hours on 19 December when Governor General Manuel António Vassalo e Silva signed the instrument of surrender bringing to an end 451 years of Portuguese Rule in Goa. In all, 4,668 personnel were taken prisoner by the Indian Army—a figure which included military and civilian personnel, Portuguese, Africans and Goan. [ 21 ] Upon the surrender of the Portuguese governor general, Goa, Daman and Diu was declared a federally administered union territory placed directly under the President of India, and Major-General K. P. Candeth was appointed as its military governor. The war had lasted two days, and had cost 22 Indian and 30 Portuguese lives. [ 74 ] Those Indian forces who served within the disputed territories for 48 hours, or flew at least one operational sortie during the conflict, received a General Service Medal 1947 with the Goa 1961 bar . [ 75 ] Portuguese actions post-hostilities [ edit ] When they received news of the fall of Goa, the Portuguese government formally severed all diplomatic links with India and refused to recognise the incorporation of the seized territories into the Indian Republic. An offer of Portuguese citizenship was instead made to all Goan natives who wished to emigrate to Portugal rather than remain under Indian rule. This was amended in 2006 to include only those who had been born before 19 December 1961. Later, in a show of defiance, Prime Minister Salazar's government offered a reward of US$10,000 for the capture of Brigadier Sagat Singh, the commander of the maroon berets of India's parachute regiment who were the first troops to enter Panaji, Goa's capital. [ 76 ] Lisbon went virtually into mourning, and Christmas celebrations were extremely muted. Cinemas and theatres shut down as tens of thousands of Portuguese marched in a silent parade from Lisbon's city hall to the cathedral, escorting the relics of St. Francis Xavier . [ 77 ] Salazar, while addressing the Portuguese National Assembly on 3 January 1962, invoked the principle of national sovereignty, as defined in the legal framework of the Constitution of the Estado Novo. ""We can not negotiate, not without denying and betraying our own, the cession of national territory and the transfer of populations that inhabit them to foreign sovereigns,"" said Salazar. [ 78 ] He went on to state that the UN's failure to halt aggression against Portugal, showed that effective power in the U.N. had passed to the Communist and Afro-Asian countries. Salazar also accused Britain of delaying for a week her reply to Portugal's request to be allowed the use of certain airfields. ""Had it not been for this delay,"" he said, ""we should certainly have found alternative routes and we could have rushed to India reinforcements in men and material for a sustained defence of the territory."" [ 71 ] Hinting that Portugal would yet be vindicated, Salazar went on to state that ""difficulties will arise for both sides when the programme of the Indianization of Goa begins to clash with its inherent culture ... It is therefore to be expected that many Goans will wish to escape to Portugal from the inevitable consequences of the invasion."" [ 71 ] In the months after the conflict, the Portuguese Government used broadcasts on Emissora Nacional , the Portuguese national radio station, to urge Goans to resist and oppose the Indian administration. An effort was made to create clandestine resistance movements in Goa, and within Goan diaspora communities across the world to use general resistance and armed rebellion to weaken the Indian presence in Goa. The campaign had the full support of the Portuguese government with the ministries of defence, foreign affairs, army, navy and finance involved. A plan was chalked out called the 'Plano Gralha' covering Goa, Daman and Diu, which called for paralysing port operations at Mormugao and Bombay by planting bombs in some of the ships anchored at the ports. [ 79 ] [ 80 ] On 20 June 1964, Casimiro Monteiro , a Portuguese PIDE agent of Goan descent, along with Ismail Dias, a Goan settled in Portugal, executed a series of bombings in Goa. [ 81 ] Relations between India and Portugal thawed only in 1974, when, following an anti-colonial military coup d'état and the fall of the authoritarian rule in Lisbon , Goa was finally recognised as part of India, and steps were taken to re-establish diplomatic relations with India. On 31 December 1974, a treaty was signed between India and Portugal with the Portuguese recognising full sovereignty of India over Goa, Daman, Diu, Dadra and Nagar Haveli. [ 82 ] In 1992, Portuguese President Mário Soares became the first Portuguese head of state to visit Goa after its annexation by India, following Indian President Ramaswamy Venkataraman 's visit to Portugal in 1990. [ 83 ] Prisoners of war [ edit ] After they surrendered, the Portuguese soldiers were interned by the Indian Army at their own military camps at Navelim , Aguada , Pondá and Alparqueiros under harsh conditions which included sleeping on cement floors and hard manual labour. [ 38 ] By January 1962, most prisoners of war had been transferred to the newly established camp at Ponda where conditions were substantially better. [ 38 ] Portuguese non-combatants present in Goa at the surrender—which included Mrs Vassalo e Silva, wife of the Portuguese Governor General of Goa—were transported by 29 December to Mumbai, from where they were repatriated to Portugal. Manuel Vassalo e Silva, however, remained along with approximately 3,300 Portuguese combatants as prisoners in Goa. [ citation needed ] Air Marshal S Raghavendran , who met some of the captured Portuguese soldiers, wrote in his memoirs several years later ""I have never seen such a set of troops looking so miserable in my life. Short, not particularly well built and certainly very unsoldierlike."" [ 84 ] In one incident, recounted by Lieutenant Francisco Cabral Couto (now retired general), on 19 March 1962 some of the prisoners tried to escape the Ponda camp in a garbage truck. The attempt was foiled, and the Portuguese officers in charge of the escapees were threatened with court martial and execution. This situation was defused by the intervention of Ferreira da Silva, a Jesuit military chaplain. [ 38 ] [ 85 ] Following the foiled escape attempt, Captain Carlos Azeredo (now retired general) was beaten with rifle butts by four Indian soldiers while a gun was pointed at him, on the orders of Captain Naik, the 2nd Camp Commander. The beating was in retaliation for Azeredo's telling Captain Naik to ""Go to Hell"", and was serious enough to make him lose consciousness and cause severe contusions . Captain Naik was later punished by the Indian Army for violating the Geneva Convention . [ 21 ] During the internment of the Portuguese prisoners of war at various camps around Goa, the prisoners were visited by large numbers of Goans—described by Captain Azeredo as ""Goan friends, acquaintances, or simply anonymous persons""—who offered the internees cigarettes, biscuits, tea, medicines and money. This surprised the Indian military authorities, who first limited the visits to twice a week, and then only to representatives of the Red Cross. [ 21 ] The captivity lasted for six months ""thanks to the stupid stubbornness of Lisbon"" (according to Azeredo). The Portuguese Government insisted that the prisoners be repatriated by Portuguese aircraft—a demand that was rejected by the Indian Government who instead insisted on aircraft from a neutral country. The negotiations were delayed even further when Salazar ordered the detention of 1200 Indians in Mozambique allegedly as a bargaining chip in exchange for Portuguese prisoners. [ 21 ] By May 1962, most of the prisoners had been repatriated—being first flown to Karachi , Pakistan , in chartered French aircraft, and then sent off to Lisbon by three ships: Vera Cruz , Pátria and Moçambique . [ 86 ] On arrival at the Tejo in Portugal, returning Portuguese servicemen were taken into custody by military police at gunpoint without immediate access to their families who had arrived to receive them. Following intense questioning and interrogations, the officers were charged with direct insubordination on having refused to comply with directives to not surrender. On 22 March 1963, the governor general, the military commander, his chief of staff, one naval captain, six majors, a sub lieutenant and a sergeant were cashiered by the council of ministers for cowardice and expelled from military service. Four captains, four lieutenants and a lieutenant commander were suspended for six months. [ 47 ] Ex-governor Manuel António Vassalo e Silva had a hostile reception when he returned to Portugal. He was subsequently court martialed for failing to follow orders, expelled from the military and sent into exile. He returned to Portugal only in 1974, after the fall of the regime, and was given back his military status. He was later able to conduct a state visit to Goa, where he was given a warm reception. [ 87 ] International reactions [ edit ] Support [ edit ] African states [ edit ] Before the invasion the press speculated about international reaction to military action and recalled the recent charge by African nations that India was ""too soft"" on Portugal and was thus ""dampening the enthusiasm of freedom fighters in other countries"". [ 34 ] Many African countries, themselves former European colonies, reacted positively to the Indian operation. Radio Ghana termed it as the ""Liberation of Goa"" and went on to state that the people of Ghana would ""long for the day when our downtrodden brethren in Angola and other Portuguese territories in Africa are liberated."" Adelino Gwambe , the leader of the Mozambique National Democratic Union stated: ""We fully support the use of force against Portuguese butchers."" [ 34 ] Also in 1961, the tiny Portuguese enclave of Fort of São João Baptista de Ajudá was annexed by the Republic of Dahomey (now Benin). Portugal recognised the annexation in 1975. [ citation needed ] Liberia insisted that Goa was not Portuguese territory but a non-self governing territory , while condemning ""Portuguese domination over Indian people for five and a half centuries"". [ 88 ] Soviet Union [ edit ] The future leader of the Soviet Union , Leonid Brezhnev , who was touring India at the time of the war, made several speeches applauding the operation. In a farewell message, he urged Indians to ignore Western indignation as it came ""from those who are accustomed to strangle the peoples striving for independence ... and from those who enrich themselves from colonialist plunder"". Nikita Khrushchev , the de facto Soviet leader, telegraphed Nehru stating that there was ""unanimous acclaim"" from every Soviet citizen for ""Friendly India"". The USSR had earlier vetoed a UN Security Council resolution condemning the Indian annexation of Goa. [ 89 ] [ 90 ] [ 91 ] Arab states [ edit ] The United Arab Republic expressed its full support for India's ""legitimate efforts to regain its occupied territory"". A Moroccan government spokesman said that ""India has been extraordinarily patient and a non-violent country has been driven to violence by Portugal""; while Tunisia 's Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs of Tunisia, Sadok Mokaddem expressed the hope that ""the liberation of Goa will bring nearer the end of the Portuguese colonial regime in Africa."" Similar expressions of support for India were forthcoming from other Arab countries. [ 71 ] Ceylon [ edit ] Full support for India's action was expressed in Ceylon , where Prime Minister Sirimavo Bandaranaike issued an order on 18 December directing that ""transport carrying troops and equipment for the Portuguese in Goa shall not be permitted the use of Ceylon's seaports and airports."" Ceylon went on, along with delegates from Liberia and the United Arab Republic , to present a resolution in the UN in support of India's annexation of Goa. [ 71 ] Ceylon argued that as Goa had been taken by force from India, it was entitled to use force in turn. [ 88 ] Indonesia [ edit ] Indonesia expressed their support and termed it a fight against colonialism. A foreign ministry spokesperson in Jakarta stated: “We know India is a peace-loving nation which has been compelled to use force. There can be no compromise with colonialism.”. [ 92 ] Condemnation [ edit ] United States [ edit ] The United States' official reaction to the annexation of Goa was delivered by Adlai Stevenson in the United Nations Security Council , where he condemned the armed action of the Indian government and demanded that all Indian forces be unconditionally withdrawn from Goan soil. [ citation needed ] To express its displeasure with India's operation in Goa, the US Senate Foreign Relations Committee attempted, over the objections of President John F. Kennedy , to cut the 1962 foreign aid appropriation to India by 25 percent. [ 93 ] Referring to the perception, especially in the West, that India had previously been lecturing the world about the virtues of nonviolence, President Kennedy told the Indian ambassador to the US, ""You spend the last fifteen years preaching morality to us, and then you go ahead and act the way any normal country would behave ... People are saying, the preacher has been caught coming out of the brothel."" [ 94 ] In an article titled ""India, The Aggressor"", The New York Times on 19 December 1961, stated ""With his invasion of Goa Prime Minister Nehru has done irreparable damage to India's good name and to the principles of international morality."" [ 95 ] The American press generally construed the war cynically, as a hypocritical and politically motivated action by Menon, with Time Magazine dubbing the annexation 'Menon's war' and writing: [ 96 ] THE man most widely held responsible for India's conquest of Goa is not Jawaharlal Nehru, but Nehru's abrasive, acerbic Defense Minister, Vengalil Krishnan Krishna Menon, who apparently provided the necessary push to overcome his master's remaining scruples. With elections due in February, Nehru and Menon have been under continuous harassment from Indian leftists for not expelling the Portuguese ""imperialists"" and from moderates and rightists for ignoring Red China's new incursions on India's northern frontier. Acting against Goa was one way to cover up inaction against China. Moreover, Menon's own parliamentary seat was in danger, and shrewd Indian political opinion held that Menon could only win if he made himself popular by ""solving"" the Goa situation. TIME Magazine, Friday, Dec. 29, 1961 Life International , in its issue dated 12 February 1962, carried an article titled ""Symbolic pose by Goa's Governor"" in which it expressed its vehement condemnation of the military action. The world's initial outrage at pacifist India's resort to military violence for conquest has subsided into resigned disdain. And in Goa, a new Governor strikes a symbolic pose before portraits of men who had administered the prosperous Portuguese enclave for 451 years. He is K. P. Candeth , commanding India's 17th Infantry Division, and as the very model of a modern major general, he betrayed no sign that he is finding Goans less than happy about their ""liberation"". Goan girls refuse to dance with Indian officers. Goan shops have been stripped bare by luxury-hungry Indian soldiers, and Indian import restrictions prevent replacement. Even in India, doubts are heard. ""India"", said respected Chakravarti Rajagopalachari , leader of the Swatantra Party , ""has totally lost the moral power to raise her voice against the use of military power"" — ""Symbolic pose by Goa's Governor"", Life International , 12 February 1962 United Kingdom [ edit ] Commonwealth Relations Secretary , Duncan Sandys told the House of Commons on 18 December 1961 that while the UK Government had long understood the desire of the local Indians to incorporate Goa, Daman, and Diu in the Indian Republic, and their feeling of impatience that the Portuguese Government had not followed the example of Britain and France in relinquishing their Indian possessions, he had to ""make it plain that H.M. Government deeply deplores the decision of the Government of India to use military force to attain its political objectives."" [ citation needed ] The Leader of the Opposition in the House of Commons Hugh Gaitskell of the Labour Party also expressed ""profound regret"" that India should have resorted to force in her dispute with Portugal, although the Opposition recognised that the existence of Portuguese colonies on the Indian mainland had long been an anachronism and that Portugal should have abandoned them long since in pursuance of the example set by Britain and France. Permanent Representative of the United Kingdom to the United Nations, Sir Patrick Dean , stated in the UN that Britain had been ""shocked and dismayed"" at the outbreak of hostilities. [ 71 ] UK's passivity was a violation of the Treaty of Windsor of 1899 . [ 97 ] Netherlands [ edit ] A Foreign Ministry spokesman in The Hague regretted that India, ""of all countries,"" had resorted to force to gain her ends, particularly as India had always championed the principles of the U.N. Charter and consistently opposed the use of force to achieve national purposes. Fears were expressed in the Dutch press lest the operation on Goa might encourage Indonesia to make a similar attack on West New Guinea . [ 71 ] On 27 December 1961, Dutch ambassador to the United States, Herman Van Roijen asked the US government if their military support in the form of the USN's 7th Fleet would be forthcoming in case of such an attack. [ 98 ] Brazil [ edit ] The Brazilian government 's reaction to the annexation of Goa was one of staunch support with Portugal, reflecting earlier statements by Brazilian presidents that their country stood firmly with Portugal anywhere in the world and that ties between Brazil and Portugal were built on ties of blood and sentiment. Former Brazilian President Juscelino Kubitschek , and long time friend and supporter of Portuguese PM Salazar, stated to Indian PM Nehru that ""Seventy million Brazilians could never understand, nor accept, an act of violence against Goa."" [ 99 ] In a speech in Rio de Janeiro on 10 June 1962, Brazilian congressman Gilberto Freyre commented on the annexation of Goa by declaring that ""a Portuguese wound is Brazilian pain"". [ 100 ] Shortly after the conflict, the new Brazilian ambassador to India, Mário Guimarães, stated to the Portuguese ambassador to Greece that it was ""necessary for the Portuguese to comprehend that the age of colonialism is over"". Guimarães dismissed the Portuguese ambassador's argument that Portuguese colonialism was based on race-mixing and the creation of multiracial societies , stating that this was ""not enough of a reason to prevent independence"". [ 101 ] Pakistan [ edit ] In a statement released on 18 December, the Pakistani Foreign Ministry spokesman described the operation on Goa as ""naked militarism"". The statement emphasised that Pakistan stood for the settlement of international disputes by negotiation through the United Nations and stated that the proper course was a ""U.N.-sponsored plebiscite to elicit from the people of Goa their wishes on the future of the territory."" The Pakistani statement (issued on 18 December) continued: ""The world now knows that India has double standards ... . One set of principles seem to apply to India, another set to non-India. This is one more demonstration of the fact that India remains violent and aggressive at heart, whatever the pious statements made from time to time by its leaders."" [ 71 ] ""The lesson from the Indian action on Goa is of practical interest on the question of Kashmir . Certainly the people of Kashmir could draw inspiration from what the Indians are reported to have stated in the leaflets they dropped ... on Goa. The leaflets stated that it was India's task to ‘defend the honour and security of the Motherland from which the people of Goa had been separated far too long' and which the people of Goa, largely by their own efforts could again make their own. We hope the Indians will apply the same logic to Kashmir. Now the Indians can impress their electorate with having achieved military glory. The mask is off. Their much-proclaimed theories of non-violence, secularism, and democratic methods stand exposed."" [ 71 ] In a letter to the US president on 2 January 1962, Pakistani President General Ayub Khan stated: ""My Dear President, The forcible taking of Goa by India has demonstrated what we in Pakistan have never had any illusions about—that India would not hesitate to attack if it were in her interest to do so and if she felt that the other side was too weak to resist."" [ 102 ] Ambivalence [ edit ] People's Republic of China [ edit ] In an official statement issued on 19 December, the Chinese government stressed its ""resolute support"" for the struggle of the people of Asia, Africa and Latin America against ""imperialist colonialism"". However, the Hong Kong Communist newspaper Ta Kung Pao described Indian actions as ""a desperate attempt by Mr. Nehru to regain his sagging prestige among the Afro-Asian nations."" The Ta Kung Pao article – published before the statement from the Chinese Government – conceded that Goa was legitimately part of Indian territory and that the Indian people were entitled to take whatever measures were necessary to recover it. At the same time, however, the paper ridiculed Mr. Nehru for choosing ""the world's tiniest imperialist country"" to achieve his aim and asserted that ""internal unrest, the failure of Nehru's anti-China campaign, and the forthcoming election forced him to take action against Goa to please the Indian people."" [ 71 ] The Catholic Church [ edit ] The Roman Catholic Archbishop of Goa and Daman and Patriarch of the East Indies was always a Portuguese-born cleric; at the time of the annexation, José Vieira Alvernaz was archbishop, and days earlier Dom José Pedro da Silva had been nominated by the Holy See as coadjutor bishop with right to succeed Alvernaz. After the annexation, Silva remained in Portugal and was never consecrated; in 1965 he became Bishop of Viseu in Portugal. Alvernaz retired to the Azores but remained titular Patriarch until resigning in 1975 after Portuguese recognition of the 1961 annexation. [ citation needed ] Although the Vatican did not voice its reaction to the annexation of Goa, it delayed the appointment of a native head of the Goan Church until the inauguration of the Second Vatican Council in Rome, when Msgr Francisco Xavier da Piedade Rebelo was consecrated Bishop and Vicar Apostolic of Goa in 1963. [ 103 ] [ 104 ] He was succeeded by Raul Nicolau Gonçalves in 1972, who became the first native-born Patriarch in 1978. [ 105 ] Legality [ edit ] Quincy Wright wrote that India's actions were of ""legal importance"" as ""it indicated a major difference between the East and the West in the interpretation"" of UN law. [ 88 ] Upon independence in 1947 India had accorded recognition to the Portuguese sovereignty over Goa. After annexing Goa India's case was built around the illegality of colonial acquisitions. This argument was correct according to the legal norms of the twentieth century, but did not hold to the standards of sixteenth century international law. India gained sympathy from much of the international community, but this did not, however, signify any legal support for the invasion. [ 106 ] The Supreme Court of India recognised the validity of the annexation and rejected the continued applicability of the law of occupation . In a treaty with retroactive effect, Portugal recognised Indian sovereignty in 1974. [ 107 ] Alina Kaczorowska-Ireland argues that under the jus cogens rule forceful annexations including the annexation of Goa are held as illegal since they have taken place after the UN Charter came into force. A later treaty cannot justify it. [ 108 ] Sharon Korman argues that the principle of self-determination may bend the rule to accommodate the new reality but it will not change the illegal aspect of the original annexation. [ 109 ] Local Indians argued that their actions were legally permitted as Goa was an integral part of India and not Portugal, and so India could not have breached the UN Charter by using force in its own territory. [ citation needed ] It also referred to the UN Charter which guarantees a right to self determination.

Portugal acquired Goa by conquest in the sixteenth century, and India recognized the Portuguese title after becoming independent in 1947. However, in the Security Council debates which followed the invasion, India argued that Portugal's title was void because it was based on colonial conquest. Such a view is correct under twentieth century notions of international law, but hardly under sixteenth-century notions. The sympathies of most of the members of the United Nations lay with India, and neither the Security Council nor the General Assembly condemned India's actions. But this does not necessarily mean that they thought India's action was legally justified. ^ Andrew Clapham; Paola Gaeta; Marco Sassòli (2015). The 1949 Geneva Conventions: A Commentary . OUP Oxford. pp. 1465–. ISBN 978-0191003523 . Archived from the original on 12 October 2023 . Retrieved 1 May 2018 . In the case of the annexation of Goa by India in 1961, the Supreme Court of India held that the annexation was valid and the law of occupation no longer applicable. In 1974, Portugal recognized the Indian sovereignty over Goa by a treaty with retroactive effect. ^ Alina Kaczorowska-Ireland (2015). Public International Law . Routledge. pp. 268–. ISBN 978-1317936411 . Archived from the original on 12 October 2023 . Retrieved 1 May 2018 . It is submitted that in the light of the jus cogens rule prohibiting the threat or use of force any annexation which has taken place after the entry into force of the UN Charter e.g. the annexation of Tibet by China in 1951, the annexation of Hyderabad by India in 1948, the annexation of Goa (despite the fact that Portugal relinquished its claim and recognised the sovereignty of India over Goa by a treaty) should be regarded as illegal and thus without any effect under international law. Such fundamental illegality can neither be justified by the subsequent conclusion of a peace treaty nor by the application of the doctrine of historic consolidation. ^ Sharon Korman (1996). The Right of Conquest: The Acquisition of Territory by Force in International Law and Practice . Clarendon Press. pp. 275–. ISBN 978-0191583803 . Archived from the original on 12 October 2023 . Retrieved 1 May 2018 . It may therefore be argued that the recognition of India's annexation of Goa involved the bending of a principle (the inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by the use of force) to accommodate a reality which was regarded as being, on the whole, beneficial, even if this situation originated in illegality. But it did not involve the abandonment of the legal principle prohibiting the acquisition of territory by force-even in respect of territories defined as colonies. The conclusion that India's successful annexation of Goa cannot be taken to indicate the existence of a legal right of reconquest in cases where a former colony seeks to recover what it considers to be its pre-colonial frontiers is reinforced-even more strongly and conclusively-by the practice of states in connection with Argentina's attempted conquest or reconquest of the Faulkland islands.

""Operation Wind"") was the code name assigned to the operation by the Indian Peace Keeping Force (IPKF) to take control of Jaffna from the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), better known as the Tamil Tigers, in late 1987 to enforce the disarmament of the LTTE as a part of the Indo-Sri Lanka Accord . In brutal fighting lasting about three weeks, the IPKF took control of the Jaffna Peninsula from the LTTE, something that the Sri Lankan Army had tried but failed to do. Supported by Indian Army tanks, helicopter gunships and heavy artillery, the IPKF routed the LTTE at the cost of 214 soldiers and officers. Background [ edit ] Main articles: Sri Lankan Civil War , Eelam War I , and Indian intervention in the Sri Lankan Civil War The Tamil Tigers had fought to establish a Tamil homeland, separate from Sri Lanka , in the northern and eastern portion of Ceylon ( Tamil Eelam ). This effort led to a series of armed conflicts with the Sri Lankan Military . In the late 1980s India , feeling considerable pressure from its Tamil citizens, began to intervene on both a diplomatic and military basis. Negotiations led to the Indo-Sri Lanka Accord , signed in Colombo on 29 July 1987, under which the Sri Lankan government agreed to give the nation's provinces more power and autonomy and withdraw its troops to their barracks. The Tamil separatists were to surrender their arms as well. [ 2 ] Most Tamil groups, including the Tigers, had not participated in the talks. Only reluctantly did they agree to surrender their arms to the Indian Peace Keeping Force as provided by the Accord. Even so, many separatists did not surrender their weapons, and the situation quickly flared into active confrontation. The Tigers declared their intent to continue armed struggle for an independent Tamil Eelam and refused to disarm. The IPKF soon found itself engaged in a bloody police action against the Tigers, which culminated in the separatists being cornered on the Jaffna Peninsula , at the northern end of the island. The IPKF set out to complete its mission of disarming the LTTE by taking Jaffna by force. [ 2 ] The Operation [ edit ] By 7 October, the Chief of the Army Staff (CoAS) had issued directives to the IPKF, laying down its operational parameters. It was to: Seize/destroy LTTE radio and TV transmission equipment in the Jaffna Peninsula Seize or jam the LTTE communications network Carry out raids on LTTE camps, caches and strongpoints Detain and interrogate personnel manning LTTE offices in the East to gain information. In case of resistance, force to be used. Actions to further consolidate the hold of the IPKF in the region The first IPKF operation was launched on 9 October 1987. Code-named Operation Pawan ( Sanskrit for 'Wind'), it was expected to neutralise LTTE operational capability in and around Jaffna. This included the capture or neutralisation of the LTTE's chain of command [ 3 ] which was expected to leave the separatist movement directionless in the face of the impending assault on the LTTE strongholds by the IPKF. On the nights of 9 and 10 October, the IPKF raided and captured the LTTE radio station at Tavadi and the TV station at Kokkuvil , while the printing presses of two LTTE-sponsored newspapers were destroyed. These operations also led to the capture of nearly 200 Tiger separatists. [ 4 ] In retaliation, the LTTE ambushed a Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) convoy near Tellippalai , killing four jawans , as well as an IPKF post at Tellipallai with automatic weapons and mortar fire on an IPKF post. Later that day the Tigers ambushed a 10 Para Commando jeep on patrol, killing all five occupants. On 10 October the Indian 91st Brigade, consisting of three battalions and led by Brig . J. Ralli, also began its push into Jaffna. [ 5 ] [ 6 ] The Jaffna University Helidrop [ edit ] Main article: Jaffna University Helidrop The first battle signalling the real beginning of Operation Pawan was the heliborne assault on the Jaffna University headquarters of the LTTE by a detachment of Indian Para (Special Forces) and Sikh Light Infantry soldiers on the night of 12 October. This was planned as a quick commando raid to capture the top LTTE leadership and local commanders who, according to Indian intelligence, were supposed to be in the building at the time and was thus expected to cut short the battle for Jaffna. [ 7 ] The plan was to land 17 commandos from the 10th battalion of the Parachute Regiment to secure the football field. A second wave was to follow with a platoon (30 troops) from the 13th battalion of the Sikh Light Infantry. The heliborne troops were to link up with the 4th battalion of 5 Gorkha Rifles (Frontier Force) of 72 Brigade and the Sikh Light Infantry troops advancing on the ground. [ 5 ] The operation ended in disaster as the LTTE, having intercepted IPKF radio transmissions, set up an ambush. The heli-dropped troops came under intense fire from LTTE positions, forcing the Mil Mi-8 helicopters to abandon the insertion midway through the operation. During the ensuing battle, which lasted throughout the night, 29 of the 30 Sikh Light Infantry troops and 2 of the 17 commandos were killed in action before detachments of the 65th Armoured Regiment were able to extract the commandos from their defensive positions. [ 5 ] After the Sikh Light Infantry platoon's signaller was shot by LTTE snipers early on in the battle, the unit lost contact with the Indian High Command at Palay Air Base . The sole survivor of the platoon, Sepoy Gora Singh, was taken prisoner by the LTTE under the command of Pawan Kashyap. It was not until his subsequent release during the conflict that the fate of the unit was known. [ 5 ] Battle for Jaffna [ edit ] As the battle for Jaffna progressed, the IPKF advance came under intense and vicious opposition from the Tigers. Fighting in built-up and an as-yet un-evacuated Jaffna, the Indian High Command insisted that the slow advance was, in addition to Tiger resistance, more a result of reluctance on the part of the IPKF to use heavy weaponry to clear LTTE defences. [ 6 ] Furthermore, all the approach roads had been laced with Claymore mines and explosives by the Tigers in its years of fighting with the Sri Lanka Army . [ 5 ] The Tigers also made extensive use of improvised explosive devices (IED) [ 5 ] which could be remotely detonated from over a kilometre away. During this time Eastern Command of the Indian Navy , supported by the Indian Coast Guard , was key in establishing a 300 miles (480 km) long blockade around northern Sri Lanka from October 1987 to disrupt the Tigers' supply and communication routes. [ 8 ] It was at about this time that the MARCOS forces (Marine Commandos) of the Indian Navy first went into action. Detachments of the IMSF (Indian Marine Special Forces, as the MARCOS was then known), along with a battalion of the 340th Independent Brigade of the Indian Army , provided beach reconnaissance around Jaffna and Batticaloa . The 340th Brigade was one of the first IPKF units to be deployed, and served until operations in the Trincomalee area were complete. The IMSF, at this time, also provided security patrols along the coast road west of Jaffna until the 41st Brigade took charge in November. On 15/16 October the IPKF stopped its advance to stabilise the front. Palay, the major operations headquarters for the 54th Infantry Division , was also secured from Tiger attacks. At this time the Indian Air Force undertook a massive airlift to reinforce the 91st with three brigades and heavy equipment, including T-72 tanks and BMP-1 infantry fighting vehicles. Air traffic controllers worked round the clock to fly in troops and equipment. Indian Airlines is said to have contributed to the airlift, using its Boeing 737s to deliver troops. [ 5 ] This short interval also saw the introduction of Mi-8 transport helicopters and the first use of the Mi-25 gunships of No. 125 Helicopter Squadron , along with HAL Cheetah utility helicopters. By end of October the IAF had flown 2200 tactical transport and 800 helicopter sorties. [ 5 ] Now reinforced, the IPKF resumed the battle for Jaffna. The tanks and armoured fighting vehicles are said to have been effective protection against anti-personnel mines . [ 5 ] However, even with this defence the IPKF advance was torturous in the face of the Tigers' sniper fire. They would take up positions on rooftops, in trees and even in coconut palms . Equipped with powerful telescopic infrared sights , they were able to selectively take out officers and radiomen, inflicting a heavy toll and bringing the advance to a grinding halt. Helicopters flying below 2000 feet were also vulnerable, with at least five being shot at and damaged before the Mi-25s took up their offensive role. The IPKF adapted quickly, with its officers taking off the pips of their ranks, wearing slouch hats and carrying oversize back packs. However, as the advance got bogged down, the battalions, instead of manoeuvring around the defenders, were forced to commit more troops under orders from New Delhi . [ 5 ] In addition, the LTTE increasingly began to deploy anti-tank mines , taking a further heavy toll on IPKF forces. A frustrated IPKF cut off the power to Jaffna in an attempt to counter this. [ 5 ] IPKF communication lines were extensively mined by the LTTE, which further compounded the sometimes perilous situations that the Indian troops faced. It has not before the commandos broke out of the besieged Jaffna port and cleared the heavily mined Navanthurai Coastal Road that a crucial link-up between 1 Maratha Light Infantry in Jaffna Fort and the advancing troops of 41st Brigade could be established that secured the Nallur area. [ 9 ] On 21 October the commandos conducted a successful amphibious raid against an LTTE base at Gurunagar . [ 10 ] It was also toward the end of the Jaffna campaign that the IPKF started the use of Mi-25s for close air support [ 11 ] when they flew against LTTE positions in Chavakachcheri town on 23 October 1987. Culmination [ edit ] Ultimately, however, after two weeks of bitter fighting the IPKF had wrested control of Jaffna and other major cities from the LTTE, but operations were to continue well into November, with major operations coming to an end with the fall of Jaffna Fort on 28 November. [ 6 ] Throughout the duration of Operation Pawan, the casualties suffered by the IPKF had been put at 600. [ 12 ] In addition to the LTTE's defensive operations alluded to above, the IPKF's problems were compounded by the fact that the Tigers, using classic guerrilla tactics, blended in with the local population. The IPKF also came face-to-face with child soldiers of the LTTE, something it had not expected. [ 5 ] This was only the beginning of the IPKF's three-year campaign to neutralise the LTTE. By the time Jaffna fell, the LTTE had merely exfiltrated out of the town, moving south to the jungles of Vavuniya District . Its hardcore militants moved to the safety of the jungle by skirting the Jaffna coast from Point Pedro to Elephant Pass , sheltered by the criss-cross of waterways in the impenetrable Nittkaikulam jungle. In the Jaffna sector, although the LTTE had shifted out of the town itself, it nevertheless harassed the 54th Division's efforts to consolidate its positions using IEDs and anti-personnel mines. In turn, the IPKF was able to disrupt the LTTE's activities with regular raids that led to the capture of large caches of separatist weaponry. [ 13 ] Brig . Manjit Singh was later replaced by Brig. J.S. Dhillon, under whom the 54th underwent considerable modifications of its operations routine. Small, highly mobile units became the staple of the 54th's operations. [ 13 ] The IPKF at this point still consisted mostly of an overstretched 54th Division. Following the Jaffna operation, the 36th Infantry Division, along with two additional brigades, took over the Vavuniya sector and the Trincomalee - Batticaloa axis. This relieved the 54th Division which, led by Brig. Singh, could now focus on consolidating the Jaffna sector. [ 13 ] The 4th Mountain Division and the 57th Infantry Division were deployed still later in February 1988 to take charge of Vanni and Batticaloa from the 36th. Criticism [ edit ] India's foreign intelligence agency Research and Analysis Wing (R&AW) trained the LTTE to keep a check on Sri Lanka , which had helped Pakistan in the Third Indo-Pakistani War by allowing Pakistani ships to refuel at Sri Lankan ports. When Prime Minister of India Rajiv Gandhi sent the Indian Peace Keeping Force (IPKF) in 1987 to restore normalcy in the region, the disastrous efforts of the IPKF was blamed on the lack of co-ordination between the IPKF and R&AW. Its most obvious manifestation was the Heliborne assault on LTTE HQ in the Jaffna University campus in the opening stages of Operation Pawan. The site was chosen without any consultation with the R&AW and the dropping paratroopers became easy targets for the LTTE, and a number of Indian soldiers were killed. [ 14 ] [ 15 ] [ 16 ] Aftermath [ edit ] The failed University of Jaffna drop and the subsequent killing of IPKF during this operation infuriated the IPKF Sikh Battalion who were stationed in Jaffna. On 21 October 1987, Hindus here were observing Diwali , IPKF stormed the largest hospital in the peninsula and massacred 70 people. Which included patients, staff and doctors. [ 17 ] [ 18 ] Prime Minister of India Rajiv Gandhi was assassinated as a fallout of Operation Pawan by LTTE.
